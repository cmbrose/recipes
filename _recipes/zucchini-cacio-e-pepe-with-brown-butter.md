## Ingredients
- 1 pound pasta
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 2  zucchini or yellow summer squash, sliced
- 1-2 cloves garlic, chopped
- Kosher salt
- 8 tablespoons salted butter
- 2 teaspoons freshly cracked black pepper
- 1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
- 1/2 cup freshly grated pecorino cheese
- Fresh basil


## Directions
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta according to package directions until al dente. Just before draining, reserve 1 1/4 cups of the pasta cooking water. Drain.
2. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the zucchini, garlic, and season with salt. Cook until the zucchini is golden, 5 minutes. Remove from the skillet to a plate.
3. Working in the same skillet, add the pepper and cook 30 seconds, until toasted. Add 4 tablespoons butter, then the pasta, 1 cup pasta cooking water, the parmesan, and pecorino. Toss vigorously to melt the cheese. Add the remaining 1/4 cup water, the zucchini, and season with salt. Toss well.
4. Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat, cook until the butter browns, 3-4 minutes.
5. Plate the pasta and spoon the butter over each serving. Top with fresh basil. Eat!
