## Ingredients
- 1/3 cup almonds
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1  small garlic clove
- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 2 cups basil leaves
- 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/4 cup nutritional yeast


## Directions
1. In a food processor, combine the pine nuts, lemon juice, garlic, salt, pepper, and pulse until well chopped.
2. Add the basil and pulse until combined.
3. With the food processor running, drizzle in the olive oil and pulse until combined.
4. For extra cheesy flavor, add 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast. For brinier flavor, add 2 teaspoons capers. For more umami, add 2 oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes. Briefly pulse to combine. Taste and adjust, adding more nutritional yeast, capers, or sun-dried tomatoes, as desired. For a smoother pesto, add more olive oil.
