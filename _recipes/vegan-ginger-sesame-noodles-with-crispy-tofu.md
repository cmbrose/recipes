## Ingredients
### SAUCE
- 2 ½ tbsp tamari
- 1 ½ tbsp avocado (or olive) oil
- 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
- 1 tbsp maple syrup
- 1 tbsp grated fresh ginger
- 2-3 tsp chili garlic sauce
- 2 tsp lime juice

### TOFU & VEGGIES
- 1 (14 oz.) package extra-firm tofu
- 1 ½ cups fresh green beans, ends trimmed, cut into thirds
- 2 cups red cabbage, sliced into 1/4-inch slices
- 1 ½ tbsp avocado (or olive) oil
- 1 tsp tamari

### NOODLES
- 8 oz. brown rice noodles

### GARNISH optional
- 3 tbsp thinly sliced green onion
- 1 tbsp sesame seeds


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 425 F (218 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Wrap your extra-firm tofu in an absorbent towel. Set something heavy on top — like a cast iron skillet — to press out extra moisture for 15 minutes. Alternatively, use a tofu press.
3. SAUCE: Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the tamari, avocado (or olive) oil, toasted sesame oil, maple syrup, grated ginger, chili garlic sauce (or sriracha), and optional lime juice. Set aside.
4. TOFU: Crumble the tofu into pieces less than 1/2 inch in size and arrange them on half of the parchment-lined baking sheet. Pour 1/4 cup of the sauce (60 ml // adjust if altering the default number of servings) over the tofu and toss to evenly coat. Set aside. Place the extra sauce into a serving bowl.
5. VEGGIES: Prepare the vegetables. Chop the green beans into thirds. Cut the cabbage into quarters, remove the core, and cut the quarters into 1/4-inch slices until you have about 2 cups sliced cabbage (adjust amount if altering batch size). Place the vegetables on the other half of the baking sheet next to the tofu. Drizzle the vegetables with oil and tamari and toss to coat, making sure to keep the tofu and vegetables separate.
6. Place the tofu and vegetables into the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, tossing halfway through, until the tofu and vegetables are crispy and lightly browned on the edges.
7. NOODLES: While the vegetables and tofu are baking, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once the water is boiling, cook your noodles of choice according to the package instructions. Once done, strain the noodles and set them aside.
8. When the tofu and vegetables are done cooking, remove from the oven and place the vegetables and noodles into the serving bowl that has the extra sauce. Toss well to coat.
9. To serve, top the noodles and veggies with the crispy tofu and garnish with optional sliced green onions and sesame seeds. Enjoy!
10. Best when fresh. Leftovers will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. Not freezer friendly.
