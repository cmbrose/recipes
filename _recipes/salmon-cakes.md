## Ingredients
- 1-1.5 lb salmon filet
- Lemon
- 1/2 onion or 1 shallot
- Olive oil
- 1-2 eggs
- 1 Tbsp mayo
- 1 tsp sweet paprika
- 1/4-1/2 cup panko


## Directions
1. Ensure all pin bones are removed from the filet
2. Cut lemon into wedges
3. Place filet skin side up into a skillet, add a couple lemon wedges on top, and fill to about 1 inch of water
4. Cover the skillet, bring to a simmer, and cook for 3-4 minutes or until the salmon is cooked 
5. Once cooked, place salmon on a cutting board then peel off and discard the skin
6. While the salmon is poaching, finely dice the onion or shallot
7. In a different skillet, heat olive oil over medium and saut√© the onion until translucent
8. Move onion to a bowl and set aside, keep the skillet to cook the patties later
9. Lightly beat 1 or 2 eggs (1 egg if using less salmon, 2 for more)
10. Whisk in mayo and paprika and a squeeze of lemon juice
11. Add the fish, onions, and panko and stir to shred the fish
12. If the mixture is too wet to form patties, add more panko or if it is too dry add more mayo. Be careful not to add too much panko as it will absorb moisture as it rests - give it some time before you add more
13. Add more oil to the skillet from the onions and heat again over medium
14. Working in 2 batches of about half the mixture, create patties, add to the skillet, and cook a couple minutes on each side - until browned
15. Set the patties on a paper towel to absorb some extra oil
16. Serve - sprinkle with more lemon juice and optionally top with mayo, yogurt, or tartar sauce
