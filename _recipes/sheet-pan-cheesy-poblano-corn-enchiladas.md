## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 2  ears corn
- 2  poblano peppers, halved
- 1  small zucchini, chopped
- 1  yellow onion, quartered
- 4  whole garlic cloves, peeled
- 3 cups salsa verde
- 2-4  chipotle chilies in adobo, chopped
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 2 teaspoons honey
- 1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- 1/3 cup fresh basil, chopped
- 10-12  corn or flour tortillas
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- 1/2 cup shredded pepper jack cheese
- Avocado, yogurt/sour cream crumbled cotija/feta, and limes, for serving


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 425Â° F.
2. Arrange the corn, poblano, zucchini, onions, and garlic on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Bake for 15-25 minutes, until the vegetables have a light char.
3. Remove the corn kernels from the cob, de-seed the poblano pepper and cut into slices, and chop the onions and garlic. Add everything back to the baking sheet and toss with 1 cup salsa verde, the chipotle, paprika, honey, half the cheese, the cilantro, and basil.
4. Pour 1 cup of the salsa verde onto the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Spoon the vegetable filling down the center of each tortilla, tuck, and roll. Place the tortillas, seam side down, into the baking dish. Pour the remaining salsa verde over top of the enchiladas. Top with the remaining cheese. Bake for 10-15 minutes, until the cheese has melted. Top as desired and enjoy warm!
