## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 pounds boneless chicken breasts, cut into 2 inch cubes
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or gluten-free flour
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, or sesame oil
- 3/4 cup high quality apricot preserves
- 1/3 cup soy sauce
- 2 Tbsp teriyaki sauce
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped or grated
- 1 inch fresh ginger, grated
- 1/2 - 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 bunch asparagus, or broccoli - chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 475° F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or grease with oil. Rinse 1c white rice and start rice cooker.
2. Mix the flour, corn starch, and pepper in a large bowl. Add the chicken and stir to coat. If needed, add more flour, there should be minimal wet spots. Place the chicken on one side of the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 12 minutes. Flip the chicken, then add the asparagus to the other side of the pan. Toss with 1 tablespoon oil, salt, and pepper. Return to the oven another 5 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Reduce the oven temp to 425° F.
3. Meanwhile, mix the apricot preserves, soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, balsamic vinegar, garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes in a glass jar or bowl.
4. Pour the sauce over the chicken, tossing to combine. Return everything to the oven for 3 minutes, until the sauce coats the chicken, watch close the sauce can burn.
5. Serve the chicken, asparagus, and sauce over bowls of rice topped with basil and sesame seeds.
