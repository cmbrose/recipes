## Ingredients
- 1 lb of dry pasta
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- Frozen veggie (zucchini, broccoli, peas, etc)
- 1 lb protein (chicken, pork, etc)

### For the creamy pasta sauce:
- 1½ cups cooked white beans, drained and rinsed
- ¼ cup chicken broth, more as needed
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- ¼ cup nutritional yeast*
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- ¼ teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- freshly ground black pepper, to taste


## Directions
1. Make the sauce: In a blender, combine the white beans, broth, lemon juice, olive oil, nutritional yeast, garlic, onion powder, salt, and pepper, and blend until smooth. Set aside.
2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare the pasta according to the instructions on the package, cooking for 2 minutes less than package directions. Add frozen zucchini and cook for remaining 2 minutes. Drain and set aside.
3. Warm chosen protein. Stir in ¾ of the sauce and pasta, adding more broth if the sauce is too dry.
4. Season to taste with more salt, pepper and lemon juice, as desired, and portion into bowls. Divide the remaining sauce onto each bowl. Top with the pine nuts and serve with lemon wedges on the side.
