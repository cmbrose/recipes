## Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 1  yellow onion, chopped
- 3  carrots, chopped
- 1 pound boneless chicken breasts, cut into cubes
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 1 1/2 cups basmati or jasmine rice
- 1/2 cup dry orzo pasta
- 2 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, plus more for topping
- 3 3/4 cups low sodium chicken broth
- 3 cups broccoli florets, frozen
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, more or less to taste
- Juice of 1/2 a lemon
- 3/4 cup whole milk
- 1 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 1/2 tsp ground mustard


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. When the oil shimmers, add the onion and carrot and cook until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chicken and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the chicken is seared, 2-3 minutes. Add the butter, rice, orzo, and thyme, and cook until golden and toasted, 2-3 minutes. Add the broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the broccoli, bay leaves, garlic powder, cayenne, and a large pinch each of salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat to low. Cook, covered for 20-25 minutes, until the rice is mostly cooked.
3. Once the rice is cooked, stir in the lemon juice, milk, and cheese. If needed, transfer the rice to an oven-safe casserole dish.
4. Transfer to the oven and bake 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is melted and just beginning to brown. Serve warm with additional thyme and fresh basil.
