## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) salted butter
- 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 3/4 cups granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 teaspoons instant coffee granules
- 3  large eggs, at room temperature
- 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 2-4 squares graham crackers, broken into pieces
- 1 (4.4 ounce) hershey chocolate bar, broken into pieces
- 1 cup marshmallow fluff


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350Â° F. Lightly butter a 10-12 inch oven-safe skillet or 9 inch brown pan.
2. In the microwave, melt together the butter and chocolate chips until melted and smooth. Stir in the sugar, vanilla, and instant coffee.
3. In a small bowl whisk the eggs for 1 minute until bubbly on top. Stir the eggs into the chocolate mix. Add the flour, cocoa powder, and baking powder. Stir until just combined.
4. Arrange 1/2 of the graham crackers and 1/2 of the chocolate bar pieces in the bottom of the prepared skillet. Spread 1/2 the brownie batter over the crackers. Dollop the fluff over the batter and add the remaining Hershey's pieces. Now add the remaining graham crackers. Top with the remaining batter, gently spreading. It's OK if the batter doesn't cover all of the fluff.  Bake for 25-28 minutes or until the brownies are just set on top, but very jiggly in the center. Remove from the oven, let cool 3-5 minutes. If you'd like to get your fluff extra toasted, you can switch the oven to broil and broil for thirty seconds or use a blow torch to toast the fluff. I love a burnt s'more. DIG in, preferably with a scoop of ice cream!
