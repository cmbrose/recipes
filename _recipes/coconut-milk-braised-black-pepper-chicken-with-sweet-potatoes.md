## Ingredients
- 2 pounds boneless, skinless, chicken thighs or breasts, cut into 2-inch chunks
- 1 tablespoon ground turmeric
- 1 tablespoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- Kosher salt
- 3 tablespoons sesame oil or extra virgin olive oil
- 2  bell peppers, sliced
- 2  medium shallots, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon chili flakes, or more
- 2 cups cubed sweet potatoes
- 2 cans (14 ounce) full-fat coconut milk
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- Steamed rice, for serving
- 1/2 cup thai basil leaves
- 2  limes
- Roasted peanuts


## Directions
1. Toss the chicken with the turmeric, ginger, cumin, pepper, a pinch of salt, and 1 tablespoon oil. Let sit 5 minutes or up to overnight in the fridge.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large Dutch oven set over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and sear on both sides until browned, about 2 minutes. Pull the chicken out of the pan.
3. To the pot, add 1 tablespoon olive oil, the peppers, shallots, garlic, and chili flakes, cook 3 minutes, then toss in the sweet potatoes. Reduce the heat to low. Pour in the coconut milk and fish sauce. Slide the chicken and any juices on the plate into the milk. Cover and simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of water. Stir in the cilantro and season with salt.
4. Divide rice between bowls, then spoon the chicken and sauce over the rice. Top with basil, peanuts, and lime juice.
