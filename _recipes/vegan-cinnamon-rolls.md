## Ingredients
### Dough
- 1 2/3 cups warm unsweetened plain non-dairy milk (approximately 110°F)
- 3 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 2 2/3 tablespoons sugar (less if milk is sweetened)
- 4 cups (627 gm) bread flour, plus extra for rolling
- 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 4 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 1/3 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Filling
- 2 2/3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2/3 cup sugar 
- 2 2/3 teaspoons cinnamon 
- (Optional) cardamom

### Icing
- 1 1/3 tablespoon almond milk
- 2 cup (227 gm) powdered sugar
- 2-4 tablespoons water or non-dairy milk
- (Optional) splash of vanilla extract


## Directions
1. Add the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt to a bowl and mix together. Stir in non-dairy milk, olive oil, and vanilla and mix until a shaggy dough forms, then knead for 2 min until smooth.
2. Add dough to a greased bowl and form into a rough ball. Cover and allowed to rise until doubled, 1-1.5 hours.
3. Line a 9 x13 inch square baking dish with parchment paper then spray with nonstick or olive oil spray. Set aside. 
4. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, then roll into a 9x18ish inch rectangle. Brush with the 2 tablespoons olive oil, leaving a ½ inch border around the edges.
5. In a small bowl, combine the sugar and cinnamon, then sprinkle evenly over the olive oil.
6. Starting with the long end, roll the dough into a tight log and pinch the seam to seal. The log will elongate a bit as you roll, so once finished sort of gently push the two edges back together to shorten / tighten the log back up.
7. With the seam side down, use a sharp or serrated knife to cut off the ends, then cut into 12 equal slices about 1 ¼ to 1 ½ inches in thickness. Arrange in the pan.
8. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm spot for about 30 to 45 minutes, or until puffy. 

Alternatively, you can refrigerate the rolls overnight instead of letting them proof again at room temperature - just DO NOT let them hang out in the fridge for longer than about 12 hours. In the morning, let them stand at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes before baking.
9. Preheat the oven to 350ºF.
10. Remove the plastic wrap and brush the proofed rolls with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.
11. Bake for about 20 to 24 minutes, until set and just barely lightly golden brown on some of the “ridges”
12. Set the pan on a wire rack and let cool for about 10 minutes.
13. In a small bowl, whisk together the icing ingredients until smooth. Add additional sugar or liquid to achieve your desired consistency, then smear over the cinnamon rolls.
