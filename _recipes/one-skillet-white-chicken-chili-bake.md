## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1  yellow onion, chopped
- 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cubed
- 4 cloves garlic, minced or grated
- 2  poblano peppers, seeded and chopped
- 1  red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
- 1  jalapeño, seeded if desired, and chopped
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 1 cup long grain rice
- 2 1/2 cups salsa verde
- 1 can white beans, drained
- 1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- 1/2 cup shredded pepper jack cheese
- Avocado and green onions, for serving
- Lime zest and juice, for serving


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 425° F.
2. In a large oven safe skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the onion and chicken and cook 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, poblano peppers, bell pepper, cumin, paprika, chili powder, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Cook 5-10 minutes, until very fragrant. Stir in the rice, cook 1-2 minutes, until lightly toasted. Add 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil. Place the lid on the skillet and turn the heat down to the lowest setting possible. Allow the rice to cook 15 minutes, until most of the liquid has cooked into the rice, but not all of it. Stir in the salsa verde, beans, and cilantro.
3. Remove from the heat and sprinkle the cheeses over the chicken/rice. Bake 10-15 minutes, until the cheese is melted.
4. Serve topped as desired with avocado, cilantro, and lime. Enjoy!
