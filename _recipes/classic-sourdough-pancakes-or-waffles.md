## Ingredients
### Overnight sponge
- 2 cups (240g) king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1 cup (227g) sourdough starter, unfed/discard
- 2 tablespoons (28g) granulated sugar
- 2 cups (454g) buttermilk

### Batter
- All of the overnight sponge
- 2 large eggs
- 1/4 cup (50g) vegetable oil or 4 tablespoons (57g) butter, melted
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda


## Directions
1. To make the overnight sponge: Stir down your refrigerated starter, and remove 1 cup (227g). Note: This is a good opportunity to feed the remainder, if necessary.
2. In a large bowl, stir together the 1 cup (227g) unfed starter, flour, sugar, and buttermilk.
3. Cover and let rest at cool room temperature (about 65°F to 70°F) for about 12 hours, or overnight.
4. To make the batter: In a small bowl or mixing cup, beat together the eggs, and oil or butter. Add to the overnight sponge, stirring just to combine.
5. Add the salt and baking soda, stirring to combine. The batter will expand and may bubble a bit.
6. To make pancakes: Pour the batter by the 1/4-cupful onto a preheated, lightly greased griddle. Cook until bubbles form and pop on the top side of the pancakes, then turn over and cook until browned underneath.
7. To make waffles: Pour the batter onto your preheated, greased waffle iron, and bake according to the manufacturer's instructions. Repeat with the remaining batter.
8. Serve pancakes or waffles immediately, with your favorite toppings; or hold in a warm oven until ready to serve.
9. Storage instructions: Store any leftovers in the refrigerator for a day or two; freeze for longer storage.
