## Ingredients
- 1  large egg, beaten
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, or use gluten-free
- 3 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
- 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 1/2 cup shredded pepper jack cheese
- 3  jalapeños, seeds removed (if desired,). 2 finely chopped, 1 sliced
- 1 clove garlic, grated
- 4  boneless skinless chicken breasts
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

### Creamed Corn 
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 4 ears corn, kernels removed from the cob
- 1/4 cup chopped green onions or chives
- 1/2 teaspoon chipotle chili powder
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 2 tablespoons avocado oil mayo
- 3/4 cup crumbled cotija or feta cheese
- 1/2 cup roughly chopped cilantro
- Lime zest and juice


## Directions
1. Preheat the broiler. Place the egg and flour in separate shallow bowls.
2. In a bowl, combine the cream cheese, 1/4 cup cheddar, 1/4 cup pepper jack, 2 finely chopped jalapeños, the garlic, and a pinch each of salt and pepper.
3. Slice the chicken through the middle horizontally, being careful not to cut all the way through the chicken. Open the chicken and stuff with 1-2 tablespoons of the jalapeño cheese mix. Close the chicken, covering the filling.
4. Dredge both sides of the chicken through the egg, and then through the flour, tossing to coat. Place the chicken on a plate.
5. Make the corn. Heat the olive oil in a large, oven safe skillet. Add the corn, chives, chili powder, cayenne, and a pinch of salt. Cook until the corn is softened, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and spoon the corn into a serving bowl. Add the mayo, cheese, and cilantro.
6. Cook the chicken. In the same skillet, melt together the butter and olive oil. Add the chicken and cook until the bottom side is golden brown, about 3-4 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook until the chicken is cooked, 4 to 5 minutes.
7. Remove from the heat, sprinkle the remaining cheeses over the chicken, then add the jalapeño slices on top. Broil 1-2 minutes, until the cheese is melted. Serve topped with corn, fresh cilantro and lime juice.
