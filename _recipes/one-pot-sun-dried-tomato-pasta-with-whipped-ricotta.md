## Ingredients
- 1 jar (8 ounce) oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
- 2  small shallots, sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 teaspoon spanish or smoked paprika
- Red pepper flakes
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 1 pound short cut pasta
- 2 cups whole milk ricotta cheese
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 cup grated parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 1/3 cup chopped fresh basil
- 1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
- 1 lb chicken breast


## Directions
1. Cut chicken into small pieces and cook in a skillet with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Set aside. 
2. Drain the oil from the sun-dried tomato jar into a large pot or skillet with sides. Chop the sun-dried tomatoes.
3. Set the pot over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and garlic, cook until fragrant, 2 minutes. Stir in the sun-dried tomatoes, paprika, and a pinch each of red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Cook until the tomatoes turn deep red and are crisping, 3-5 minutes. Add 3 1/2 cups water. Bring to a boil, add the pasta, and cook, stirring often, until the pasta is al dente, 8 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, whip the ricotta and lemon in a food processor until creamy. Season with salt.
5. To the pasta, stir in in the parmesan and butter until very creamy. Remove from the heat and stir in the basil, parsley, and dill.
6. Swirl the ricotta into a large pasta bowl or individual bowls. Add the hot pasta and lightly toss with the ricotta. Top each bowl with additional herbs and parmesan. Place chicken pieces on top.
