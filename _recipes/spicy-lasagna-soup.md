## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1  yellow onion, chopped
- 1/2 cup chopped, celery
- 2  red bell peppers, chopped
- 6 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1/2 pound ground beef, bison, or chicken
- 1/2 pound spicy italian sausage
- 1 tablespoon dried basil
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 2 teaspoons dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1/2 cup tomato paste
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 4 cups low sodium chicken broth
- 1 can (28 ounce) crushed tomatoes
- 1/2 cup canned coconut milk, milk, or cream
- 1 cup shredded provolone cheese
- 1/2 cup grated parmesan
- 8-12  lasagna noodles, broken into pieces


## Directions
1. Heat the olive oil in a large dutch oven over high heat. Add the onion, celery, and red pepper, and cook until the veggies are softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 1 minute.
2. Add the meat and sausage. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up the meat as it cooks, until browned all over, 10 minutes. Add the tomato paste, basil, oregano, thyme, and chili flakes and cook 5 minutes, then pour in the wine. Add the crushed tomatoes and broth. Season with salt and pepper. Cook 10-20 minutes until thickened slightly.
3. Stir in the milk and cook until warmed through, 10 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, boil the noodles until al dente. Drain and add back to the pot with the cheeses. Ladle the soup into bowls and serve topped with parmesan and fresh herbs. Enjoy!
