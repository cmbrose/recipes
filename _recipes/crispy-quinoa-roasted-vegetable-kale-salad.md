### QUINOA + MUSHROOMS

- 2 tbsp coconut aminos

### SALAD + DRESSING

- 2 tbsp tahini
- 1/8 tsp each sea salt + black pepper

## Directions
1. If you haven’t already prepared your quinoa (or grain of choice), do so now on the stovetop or in the Instant Pot. Let cool, then proceed to step 2. (Note: Time to cook grains is not included in total prep / cook time).
2. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line two small baking sheets with parchment paper.
3. To one baking sheet, add the chopped carrots, bell pepper, onion, and beet. Toss the vegetables with 2 Tbsp of oil (adjust if altering batch size), Italian herbs, red pepper flakes (optional), garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
4. To the second baking sheet, add the cooked, cooled quinoa and sliced shiitake mushrooms. Toss with 2 tsp of oil (adjust if altering batch size) and coconut aminos. Roast the veggies and quinoa for ~20 minutes or until the vegetables are tender and golden brown and the quinoa is crispy. Toss as needed to ensure even cooking.
5. To your serving bowl or a mixing bowl, add chopped kale, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, tahini, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. Massage for 1-2 minutes to combine and slightly tenderize the kale. Set aside.
6. To serve, top the kale salad with the crispy quinoa and mushrooms, roasted vegetables, and desired additional toppings, such as avocado, hemp seeds, toasted almonds, and vegan parmesan cheese (all optional).
7. Enjoy right away or store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours, or 2-3 days if leaving out the avocado.
