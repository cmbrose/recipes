## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 pounds boneless chicken breasts, cut into cubes
- 1  egg white
- 1 tablespoon tamari or soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon orange zest
- Black pepper
- 1/2 cup cornstarch
- 1/3 cup avocado oil

### Orange Sauce
- 4 cloves garlic, grated
- 1 tablespoon fresh grated ginger
- 1/2-1 teaspoon chili flakes
- 1/3 cup low sodium chicken broth
- 1 cup fresh orange juice + 2 tablespoons zest (about 3 oranges)
- 1/3 cup tamari or soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 3 tablespoons honey

## Directions
1. In a bowl, combine the chicken, egg white, tamari/soy sauce, orange zest, and pepper. Toss well to coat. In a separate bowl, add half the cornstarch.
2. Dredge the chicken through the cornstarch to coat. Add remaining cornstarch as needed.
3. In a glass jar, whisk together the broth, orange juice, tamari/soy sauce, rice vinegar, and honey.
4. Heat the avocado oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the chicken, working in batches if needed, cook until golden all around, about 5 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet.
5. To the skillet, add more oil, the garlic, ginger, and chili flakes. Cook 1-2 minutes. Pour in the orange sauce. Bring to a boil, boil 3-4 minutes, then add the chicken. Toss with the sauce and cook until the sauce thickens around the chicken, about 5 minutes.
6. Serve the chicken and sauce over steamed rice with sesame seeds and green onions. See side suggestions.
