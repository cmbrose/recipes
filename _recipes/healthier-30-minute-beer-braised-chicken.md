## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
- 3 slices thick-cut bacon, chopped
- 2  small yellow onions, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced or grated
- 1 (12 ounce) pumpkin beer, or whatever you drink
- 1 can (14 ounce) diced fire-roasted tomatoes with chilies
- 1 tablespoon apple butter or real maple syrup
- 1  red bell peppers, chopped
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, roughly chopped
- Cooked white or brown rice, for serving


## Directions
1. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Place the flour in a shallow bowl and dredge the chicken through the flour, coating it completely.
2. Set Instant Pot to sauté. Add the bacon and cook until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove the bacon. If there's excess bacon grease, drain off all but 1 tablespoon. Add the chicken to the instant pot and sear on both sides until browned, about 2 minutes. Add the onions and garlic, cook 3 minutes. Turn the instant pot off.
3. To the instant pot, add the beer, tomatoes, apple butter, bell pepper, chili powder, paprika, thyme, cayenne, and season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook on high pressure for 6 minutes.
4. Once done cooking, use the natural or quick release function. Set the Instant pot to sauté and bring to a boil, boil 10-12 minutes or until the liquid reduces slightly. Turn the instant pot off. Remove the thyme and discard. Stir in the parsley and reserved bacon.
5. Serve the chicken and sauce over rice.
6. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Place the flour in a shallow bowl and dredge the chicken through the flour, coating it completely.
7. Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove the bacon. If there's excess bacon grease, drain off all but 1 tablespoon. Add the chicken and sear until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the skillet and place directly into the slow cooker. Add the onions, garlic, beer, tomatoes, apple butter, bell pepper, chili powder, paprika, thyme, cayenne, and season with salt and pepper. Cover the slow cooker and cook on low for 6-8 hours or on high for 3-4 hours.
8. Remove the lid, cook 30 minutes on high to thicken the sauce. Remove the thyme and discard. Stir in the parsley and reserved bacon.
9. Serve the chicken and sauce over rice.
10. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Place the flour in a shallow bowl and dredge the chicken through the flour, coating it completely.
11. Cook the bacon in a large braiser over medium heat until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove the bacon. If there's excess bacon grease, drain off all but 1 tablespoon. Add the chicken and sear until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Add the onions and garlic, cook 5 minutes.
12. Reduce the heat to low. Add the beer, tomatoes, apple butter, bell pepper, chili powder, paprika, thyme, cayenne, and season with salt and pepper. Partially cover and simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Stir in the parsley and reserved bacon.
