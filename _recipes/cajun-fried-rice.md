## Ingredients
- Vegetable or grapeseed oil 4 teaspoons
- Chicken andouille sausage 12 ounces
- Peeled shrimp 8 ounces
- Low-sodium cajun seasoning blend 1 teaspoon
- White or yellow onion ½
- Thawed frozen cauliflower rice 2 cups
- Kosher salt ¼ teaspoon
- Scallions 4
- Garlic 4 cloves
- Cooked brown rice 3 cups
- Low sodium soy sauce or gluten-free tamari 2 tablespoons
- Large eggs 3
- Sriracha and/or louisiana-style hot sauce


## Directions
1. In a large pan, heat 1 teaspoon oil over medium-high heat.
2. When the oil is hot, add the sausage in a single layer (work in batches if needed) and cook for 1 to 2 minutes per side, until browned. Transfer the sausage to a plate and set aside.
3. Add the chopped shrimp to a plate or mixing bowl and season with the Cajun seasoning blend.
4. Add 1 teaspoon oil to the pan and decrease the heat to medium.
5. Add the onion, cauliflower rice, and salt and cook, stirring often, for 3 to 5 minutes, until the onions are soft and translucent and any residual moisture from the cauliflower has cooked off.
6. Add the seasoned shrimp, scallion whites (reserve the greens for garnish), and garlic and cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute, just until the garlic is fragrant and the scallions start to soften. It’s OK if the shrimp isn’t completely cooked through at this stage.
7. Push everything to one side of the pan.
8. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil to the pan along with the brown rice and soy sauce.
9. Stir to incorporate, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook without stirring for 2 to 3 minutes so the bottom starts to become crispy.
10. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, just until the rice is heated through.
11. Push the rice to the side of the pan with the cooked vegetables and pour the beaten eggs into the pan. Use a spatula to scramble them until they are just barely cooked.
12. Add the reserved andouille sausage to the pan and stir everything to incorporate.
13. If needed, season with more salt. Serve immediately, garnished with scallion greens and (optional) hot sauce.
