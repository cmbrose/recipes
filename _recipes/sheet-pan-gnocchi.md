## Ingredients
- 1 pound store-bought potato gnocchi (we like isola)
- 1  bunch broccolini
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes
- ½  small red onion
- 2  garlic cloves
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- ½ teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
- ½ teaspoon za’atar
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 6 ounces feta cheese
- Fresh parsley


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 450°F and line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, toss together the gnocchi, broccolini, cherry tomatoes, onion, garlic, olive oil, salt, thyme, za’atar, red pepper flakes, and several grinds of pepper. Spread evenly on the baking sheet.
3. Roast for 10 minutes. Stir, then scatter the feta on top. Roast for 15 to 20 more minutes, or until the gnocchi is tender and the vegetables and feta are browned. Garnish with parsley, if desired. Season to taste and serve.
