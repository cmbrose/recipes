- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1  shallot, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic finely, chopped or grated
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika

### Honey'd Feta Sauce 
- 6 ounces feta cheese
- Juice from 1 lemon

- Red pepper flakes
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh tender herbs, such as dill, basil, or parsley


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 425° F.
2. On a baking sheet, toss together the chicken, olive oil, shallot, garlic, rosemary, paprika, chili powder, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Add the lemon wedges. Bake 15 minutes, toss and bake another 5-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Switch the oven to broil. Broil 1-2 minutes, until the chicken chars on the edge. *Watch closely!
3. Meanwhile, make the feta sauce. Combine all ingredients in a food processor and blend until smooth. Season to taste with chili flakes, then top with mixed herbs and a drizzle of oil.
