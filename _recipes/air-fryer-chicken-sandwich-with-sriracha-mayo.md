## Ingredients
- 16 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breasts 2
- 1% buttermilk 1 cup
- Pickle juice 1 cup
- Large egg 1
- Kosher salt
- All purpose flour 1/2 cup
- Garlic powder 1/2 teaspoon
- Paprika 1/2 teaspoon
- Cayenne pepper 1/8 teaspoon
- Olive oil spray
- Light mayo 4 tablespoons
- Sriracha 1 tablespoon
- Dill pickle chips 12
- Whole wheat potato rolls 4


## Directions
1. Pound out the thicker end of the chicken breast to make the thickness even on both ends, about 1/2-inch thick, this will ensure the chicken cooks even, then cut each breast in half to make 4 pieces.
2. Whisk buttermilk and pickle juice in a bowl.
3. Add chicken and toss to coat; cover with plastic wrap and chill at least 6 hours or overnight.
4. Combine flour, garlic powder, paprika, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and cayenne pepper in a shallow bowl. 
5. Whisk egg in another bowl.
6. Line the air fryer basket with an air fryer parchment liner (these are sold on Amazon, look for parchment with the holes).
7. Working with one chicken breast at a time, dip chicken in flour mixture, shaking off excess. Then into the egg and back into the flour, using the back of a fork to coat well so it adheres.
8. Shake excess then transfer to the prepared air fryer basket and spray tops with oil.
9. Air fry in batches as needed 380F until golden and cooked through, about 15 to 18 minutes, turning halfway depending on the thickness, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast reads 165°F.
10. Meanwhile combine sriracha and mayo in a small bowl.
11. To assemble sandwiches, place the mayo on the top of rolls, place the chicken on the bottom roll followed by the pickle chips and tops of rolls.
