## Ingredients
- 1 (14-oz.) package extra-firm tofu
- 1 ½ tbsp tamari
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 3 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1 ½ tbsp tomato paste
- 4-5 small cloves garlic, crushed or minced
- 2 tsp dried basil
- 1 ½ tsp dried oregano
- 3/4 tsp dried thyme
- 1/4 tsp sea salt


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 425 F (218 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Wrap your extra-firm tofu in an absorbent towel. Set something heavy on top — like a cast iron skillet — to press out extra moisture for 15 minutes. Alternatively, use a tofu press.
3. Crumble the tofu into pieces less than 1/2-inch in size and arrange them on the parchment-lined baking sheet.
4. In a small bowl, whisk the remaining ingredients (tamari, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, tomato paste, garlic, basil, oregano, thyme, and salt). Pour over the tofu and toss to coat.
5. Bake for 20 minutes, flip with a spatula, and bake for another 10-15 minutes or until the tofu is a little firm and golden with crispy edges.
6. Enjoy warm or at room temperature. This tofu is the perfect protein boost for wraps, risotto, polenta, creamy pink pasta, pasta arrabiata, or on pizza or paired with roasted vegetables.
7. Leftovers keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for 3-4 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month. Reheat in a skillet or in the oven at 350 F (176 C) for 5-10 minutes until warm and crispy.
