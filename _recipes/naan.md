## Ingredients
### Dough
- 1 1/2 cups (180g) king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup (90g) king arthur unbleached bread flour
- 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons (142g) water, warm
- 5 tablespoons (71g) plain greek yogurt, full-fat
- 2 tablespoons (28g) ghee or butter, melted
- 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
- 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt

### Topping
- 2 tablespoons (28g) ghee or butter, melted
- 2 teaspoons nigella seeds, optional
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, roughly chopped, optional


## Directions
1. Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, combine all the dough ingredients and mix until shaggy. Knead the dough until it’s smooth, bouncy, and slightly tacky.
2. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let it rise until doubled, about 50 to 60 minutes.
3. Divide the dough into eight equal pieces (about 65g each). Shape each into a ball, cover, and let rest for 20 minutes.
4. While the dough is resting, preheat a cast iron pan over medium-high heat, or an electric griddle to medium-high.
5. On a lightly floured surface, hand stretch or use a rolling pin to roll each ball into a 6” round or 7" oblong, for thicker naan; or an 8" round or 10” oblong, for thinner naan. Keep the other pieces covered while working.
6. Once the pan or griddle is hot, cook the naan for 30 to 40 seconds, until bubbles form on the top side and the underside browns. Flip it over to brown the other side for 40 to 50 seconds, checking regularly to ensure doneness.
7. Remove the bread from the pan, and brush with melted ghee or butter. Sprinkle with seeds and cilantro, if desired. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Keep the finished naan in a warm oven (200°F), or wrap in foil until ready to serve.
8. Store naan, well wrapped, at room temperature for two days; freeze for longer storage.
