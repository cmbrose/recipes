## Ingredients
- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 1/2 cups dry wild rice blend
- 6  carrots, chopped
- 3  stalks celery, chopped
- 2  medium shallots, chopped
- 6 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme or 2 teaspoons dried
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage or 1 teaspoon dried
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 2 cups fresh baby spinach or kale
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1 cup heavy cream or whole milk
- 1/2 cup grated parmesan, plus more for serving
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 6 tablespoons salted butter, melted
- 2 pounds mixed mushrooms, roughly torn
- 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
- 4 cloves garlic, smashed
- Zest from 1 lemon


## Directions
1. In the bowl of your slow cooker, combine the rice, chicken, carrots, celery, shallots, broth, thyme, sage, crushed red pepper, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Add 1/2 cup water. Cover and cook on low for 5-6  hours or on high for 2-3 hours.
2. Shred the chicken with 2 forks. Stir in the cream, parmesan, and spinach. Cook until warmed through, about 30 minutes. Stir in the parsley. If the soup is thick, add an additional 1/2 cup water.
3. To make the mushrooms. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. On a baking sheet, combine the butter, mushrooms, garlic, rosemary, lemon zest, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Transfer to the oven and roast for 25-30 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking, until the mushrooms are golden and crisp
4. Mash the garlic with a fork, then stir in the mushrooms, mashed garlic, and any butter left into the soup.
5. Divide the soup among bowls and top with rosemary and additional parmesan.
