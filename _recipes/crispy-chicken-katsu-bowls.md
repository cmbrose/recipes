## Ingredients
- 2/3 cup, plus 2 tablespoons tamari or soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 teaspoons grated ginger
- 2 tablespoons chopped green onions
- 1 teaspoon, plus 3 tablespoons sesame seeds
- 4  chicken cutlets, or 2 boneless chicken breasts, sliced in half horizontally
- 1 cup panko
- Chili flakes
- 1 bag frozen shelled edamame
- 3-4 cups rice, cooked
- Cucumber, avocado, pickled ginger, and nori sheets – for serving

### Spicy Mayo
- 1/3 cup olive oil mayo
- 1 to 2 tablespoons sriracha
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce or tamari
- 1 teaspoon honey


## Directions
1. Start cooking rice
2. In a medium bowl, combine 2/3 cup tamari/soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, ginger, green onion, 1 teaspoon sesame seeds, and chili flakes.
3. Place the chicken in a bowl and pour over 3-4 tablespoons of the sauce, save the rest for serving. Let the chicken sit 10 minutes.
4. Place the Panko and 3 tablespoons sesame seeds in a shallow bowl. Dredge both sides of the chicken through the Panko, pressing to adhere by using your fist to pound the crumbs in. Place the chicken on a plate.
5. Heat a few tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add the chicken and cook until golden brown, 3-4 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 3-4 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board.
6. Add the edamame to the skillet, cook until thawed, then add 2 tablespoons tamari/soy sauce. Cook another minute, then remove from the heat.
7. To make the Spicy Mayo, combine all ingredients in a small bowl.
8. To assemble, slice the chicken into thin strips. Add the rice to bowls, top with cucumber, avocado, chicken, pickled ginger, green onions, and nori. Spoon over the spicy mayo and the reserved tamari/soy sauce.
