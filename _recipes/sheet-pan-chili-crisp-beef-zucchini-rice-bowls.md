## Ingredients
- 1 pound flank steak or tenderloin, cubed
- Black pepper
- 1 tablespoon arrowroot or cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons sesame or olive oil
- 2-3 tablespoons gochujang
- 1 tablespoon tamari or soy sauce
- 1/3 cup pickled ginger, patted dry
- 1  shallot, chopped
- 2  small zucchini, sliced
- 1-2  red bell peppers, sliced or 8 mini peppers
- 6 tablespoons salted butter
- 3-4 cloves garlic, chopped
- Chili flakes
- 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
- 1/3 cup mayo
- 1 tablespoon ginger juice
- 3-4 cups cooked rice


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 475Â° F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or rub with oil.
2. On the sheet pan, toss together the steak, arrowroot, and pepper. Add 1 tablespoon oil, Gochujang, and tamari, tossing to coat. Toss with the pickled ginger. Arrange the steak to one side of the baking sheet. Add the zucchini and peppers to the other side. Toss with oil, salt, and pepper. Bake for 10 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, in a small skillet melt together the butter, garlic, and 1-3 tablespoons chili flakes. Cook until the butter is browning and the garlic crisps. Mix in the sesame seeds.
4. Switch the oven to broil. Broil the beef for 2-5 minutes, until the meat is crisping. Watch closely. Pull the pan out of the oven. Toss the steak with 1/4 cup chili butter.
5. Mix 1-2 tablespoons of chili butter with the mayo and 1 tablespoon of ginger juice.
6. Serve the steak, zucchini, and peppers with extra chili butter, basil, and green onions over steamed rice. Drizzle with spicy mayo.
