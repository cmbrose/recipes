## Ingredients
- 6 tablespoons salted butter
- 3-4  medium yellow onions, thinly sliced
- 1 1/4 cups dry white wine, such as pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc
- 3 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2 cups cremini or wild mushrooms, sliced
- 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage
- 3 cups low sodium chicken or vegetable broth
- 1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce
- 1 pound short cut pasta
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 3 ounces prosciutto, torn
- 1/2 cup heavy cream or milk
- 1 cup shredded gruyere cheese
- 4 ounces burrata cheese, at room temperature


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350° F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange the prosciutto in a single layer. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until the prosciutto is crisp.
2. Meanwhile, melt together the butter and onions in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally until softened, about 10 minutes. At this point, you'll want to slowly add 3/4 cup of the wine, 1/4 cup at a time, until the wine cooks into the onions. Continue to cook another 10-15 minutes until you've used the 3/4 cup of wine and the onions are deeply caramelized.
3. Add the garlic, mushrooms, thyme, and sage. Season with salt and pepper, cook another 3-4 minutes. Add the remaining 1/2 cup wine, the broth, Worcestershire sauce, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil.
4. Add the pasta and stir frequently until the pasta is al dente and the broth has been absorbed, about 8-10 minutes. Stir in the cream and gruyere cheese. Remove from the heat.
5. Break the burrata over the pasta and gently stir. Top with prosciutto. Eat and enjoy!
