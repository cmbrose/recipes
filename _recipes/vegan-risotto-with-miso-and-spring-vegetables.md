## Ingredients
### MISO BROTH
- 5 cups water, divided
- 4 tbsp chickpea miso paste

### RICE & VEGGIES
- 2 tbsp olive oil, divided
- 1/2 bunch asparagus, cut into 1/2-inch segments on a bias/diagonal
- 1 cup shiitake mushrooms, sliced
- 1 pinch each sea salt and black pepper
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup arborio rice
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 1/2 cup frozen peas

### FOR SERVING optional
- 1/4 cup vegan parmesan cheese


## Directions
1. MISO BROTH: In a medium saucepan, bring water to a simmer over medium heat. Once simmering, reduce heat to low to keep warm.
2. While waiting for the water to simmer, add miso to a small mixing bowl and scoop out ~1 cup (240 ml) of water from the saucepan. Add to the miso and whisk/stir until mostly dissolved (this allows the miso to fully blend with the water and not clump). Add the miso mixture to the pot of simmering water and stir to dissolve the miso fully. This creates your miso broth.
3. RISOTTO: Heat a large rimmed skillet over medium-high heat and add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) olive oil (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Add the asparagus and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until somewhat browned and caramelized. Add the mushrooms and sauté for ~2 minutes, or until tender. Season with a pinch each of salt and pepper and transfer to a bowl. Set aside for later.
4. Heat the same large skillet over medium-low heat. Add remaining olive oil (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and garlic. Sauté for 1 minute until fragrant.
5. Add arborio rice and cook for 1 minute, stirring occasionally to coat.
6. Optionally, add dry white wine (or vegetable broth) and stir gently. Cook for 1-2 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed.
7. Using a ladle, add warmed miso broth 1/2 cup (120 ml) at a time, stirring almost constantly, giving the risotto little breaks to come back to a simmer. The heat should be medium, and there should always be a slight simmer. You want the mixture to be cooking but not boiling, or it will get gummy and cook too fast.
8. Continue to add miso broth, stirring to incorporate, until the rice is al dente — cooked through but still has a slight bite. You may not need all of the miso broth. This whole process should only take 15-20 minutes (time based on original recipe // adjust if altering batch size).
9. Once the rice is al dente, turn heat as low as possible and add in peas, along with the cooked asparagus and mushrooms from earlier (option to reserve a few for serving). Stir until well combined, testing a bite to ensure peas are warmed through.
10. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding a pinch of salt and pepper to taste or some  vegan parmesan cheese to enhance the cheesiness.
11. To serve, divide between serving bowls, top with any remaining asparagus and mushrooms, and garnish with vegan parmesan cheese.
12. Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop over medium heat, adding vegetable broth or water as needed to rehydrate. Not freezer friendly.
