## Ingredients
- 1  large egg, beaten
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour or use gluten free
- 1 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
- 4  boneless skinless chicken breast cutlets
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 6 tablespoons cold salted butter, cubed
- 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 3/4 cup dry white wine, such as pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc
- 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 2-3  peaches, sliced
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 8 ounces burrata cheese, at room temperature
- 1/3 cup basil pesto
- 1/2 cup fresh basil, torn


## Directions
1. Preheat the broiler. Place the egg and flour in separate shallow bowls. Toss the rosemary with the flour.
2. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Dredge both sides of the chicken through the egg, and then through the flour, tossing to coat. Place the chicken on a plate.
3. In an oven safe skillet, melt together 3 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil.
4. Add the chicken and cook until the bottom side is golden brown, about 3-4 minutes. Flip the chicken and add 3 tablespoons butter, swirling the butter around the chicken. Cook, basting the chicken in butter until the chicken is cooked and golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes.
5. Reduce the heat to medium low and pour in the wine and lemon juice. Simmer 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, arrange the peaches around the chicken. Drizzle the peaches with honey, salt and chili flakes (if desired). Broil 1 minute, until the peaches are softened.
6. Break the burrata over the peaches and chicken. Spoon the pesto over the entire skillet. Let sit 5 minutes to warm the cheese. Serve topped with lots of fresh basil.
