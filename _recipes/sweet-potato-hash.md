## Ingredients
- 4 teaspoons avocado oil
- ½  small red onion
- 1  poblano pepper
- 2  garlic cloves
- 1  large sweet potato
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 4 leaves lacinato kale
- 4  large eggs
- 1  avocado
- Fresh cilantro leaves
- Hot sauce
- Lime wedges
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper


## Directions
1. Heat 2 teaspoons of the avocado oil in a large lidded skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, poblano, garlic, and ¼ teaspoon sea salt and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until softened. Remove from the pan and set aside.
2. Heat the remaining 2 teaspoons avocado oil in the skillet. Add the sweet potatoes and ¼ teaspoon sea salt and cook, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are fork-tender. Add the sautéed veggies back to the pan and stir in the chili powder and kale.
3. Make 4 shallow wells in the hash and crack in the eggs. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the eggs are just set. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
4. Top with the avocado slices and garnish with cilantro, if using. Serve with hot sauce and lime wedges for squeezing.
