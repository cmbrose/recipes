## Ingredients
- ⅔ cup unsalted natural creamy peanut butter*
- ½ cup maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons melted coconut oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Heaping ½ teaspoon sea salt*
- 2½ cups whole rolled oats
- ¼ cup mini chocolate chips


## Directions
1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, stir together the peanut butter, maple syrup, coconut oil, vanilla, and salt until smooth. Add the oats and chocolate chips and stir until combined. Use a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop to portion the dough. Use your hands to form into balls and place on the baking sheet, then flatten into disks with your fingers (the disks will become more cohesive as they chill). Chill overnight to allow the cookies to firm up.
