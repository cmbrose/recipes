## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1  yellow onion chopped
- 2 cups mushrooms, sliced
- 2-4 cloves garlic, minced or grated
- 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves (or 2 teaspoons dried)
- 1 tablespoon fresh basil (or 1 teaspoon dried)
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- Red pepper flakes
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 6 cups low sodium chicken broth
- 3/4 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 8  lasagna noodles broken into pieces
- 4-6 cups baby spinach, roughly chopped
- 1 cup canned coconut milk, heavy cream, or whole milk
- 1 cup shredded provolone cheese
- 1/2 cup grated parmesan
- 2 ounces prosciutto torn


## Directions
1. Melt the butter and flour together in a large pot. Cook 1-2 minutes, then add the onion, mushrooms, thyme, basil, oregano, and garlic, stirring to combine. Stir in the chicken broth. Add the chicken and season with chili flakes, salt, and pepper.
2. Cover and cook over medium heat for 20-25 minutes, until the chicken is cooked. Shred the chicken.
3. Bring the soup to a boil over high heat. Stir in the noodles, spinach, and cream. Let cook on high until the noodles are soft, about 8 minutes. Alternately, you can cook the noodles in boiling water, then stir them into the soup.
4. Stir in the cheeses until melted. If the soup is too thick, add additional broth or water to thin.
5. Meanwhile, Preheat the oven to 350° F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange the prosciutto in a single layer. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until the prosciutto is crisp.
6. Serve the soup topped with the prosciutto.
