## Ingredients
### Pepper Ingredients
- 4 bell peppers
- 3 cups pulled pork
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes
- 2 tbsp diced red onions
- 15 oz fire roasted tomatoes
- 2 tbsp heavy cream / milk
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 tsp dried basil
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 cup grated mozzarella

### Side
- Quinoa


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil. Start the quinoa.
2. Remove the seeds and inside stems of the peppers. Fill the peppers with 1/3 to ½ cup pulled pork (or as much as you wish!). Sprinkle on some of the tomatoes and diced onion.
3. Place the tomatoes in a blender and puree until smooth. Blend in the cream, sugar, garlic, basil, salt and pepper until combined. Spoon the mixture over top of the pork in the pepper. Sprinkle on the cheese.
4. Bake the peppers for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly. Sprinkle of fresh parsley (or your favorite herb!) and serve immediately.
