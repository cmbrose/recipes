## Ingredients
- 4 (~6 oz. each) boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 2 tsp dried italian herb blend
- 1/4 tsp sea salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
- 3-4 tbsp basil pesto
- 2 tsp olive oil


## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and set out a large cast iron skillet (10-12 inch).
2. To a mixing bowl, add the chicken thighs, garlic powder, dried Italian herbs, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and pesto. Mix well until evenly coated, adding 1 Tbsp more pesto if using homemade (it's not usually as concentrated in flavor).
3. Heat the cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil and wait 1 minute for it to get hot. Add chicken thighs (skin side down if using skin-on) and cook until golden brown on the underside, about 3-4 minutes. Then flip and cook for 2-3 minutes more.
4. Once browned on both sides, carefully transfer the skillet to the oven (using an oven mitt) and bake until the internal temperature reads 170F / 76C (make sure to insert into the center and not hit bone for an accurate reading) â€” about 5-10 minutes, depending on the size of your chicken thighs.
5. Remove from the oven and let rest in the pan for ~5 minutes before serving.
6. This dish pairs well with roasted potatoes, roasted eggplant, pesto pasta salad, roasted asparagus, or a simple green salad.
7. Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave until hot. Not freezer friendly.
