## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 1  yellow onion, chopped
- 2  shallots, sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2 ribs celery, chopped
- 6  carrots, chopped
- 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
- 1  bay leaf
- 1/3 cup dry sherry
- 8 cup low sodium chicken broth
- 1 pound boneless chicken breasts or thighs
- 2-3 cups egg noodles
- 1/3 cup shaved parmesan cheese
- 1/4 cup chopped parsley


## Directions
1. Melt together the olive oil and butter In a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onions and cook another 3-5 minutes. Add the shallots, garlic, celery, carrots, thyme, sage, and rosemary. Season with salt and pepper. Cook another 5 minutes.
2. Pour in the sherry and broth, and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in the chicken, bay leaf, and if you have one – a parmesan rind. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. At this point, the soup can also simmer on low for up to 4-6 hours.
3. Shred the chicken, remove the parmesan rind and bay leaf. Taste, and season with salt and pepper. Bring the soup back to a boil, then add the noodles and cook 6-8 minutes, until soft. Stir in the parmesan and parsley.
4. Serve the soup topped with additional parmesan, if desired.
