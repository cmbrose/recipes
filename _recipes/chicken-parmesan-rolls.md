## Ingredients
### For the dough:
- All purpose or white whole wheat flour 1 cup
- Baking powder 1 1/2 teaspoons
- Kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon
- Stonyfield non-fat greek yogurt 1 cup

### For the filling:
- Organic grilled chicken breast 8 ounces
- Marinara sauce 1/2 cup
- Shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese 3/4 cup

### For the egg wash:
- Large egg 1
- Sesame seeds


## Directions
1. In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking powder and salt and whisk well.
2. Add the yogurt and mix with a fork or spatula until well combined, it will look like small crumbles.
3. Lightly dust flour on a work surface and remove dough from the bowl, knead the dough a few times until smooth, not lumps. The dough will be tacky, but not sticky, about 20 turns (it should not leave dough on your hand when you pull away).
4. Preheat the oven 425F.  Line a sheet pan with a silicone mat.
5. Divide into 4 equal balls, about 3-3/8 ounces each.
6. Lightly sprinkle a work surface and rolling pin with flour and roll the dough out into thin rounds, 7 inches in diameter.
7. Spread 1 tablespoon of marinara down the center of the circle in a strip, top with 1/2 cup of the chicken (2 oz) 1 tablespoon more marinara sauce and 3 tablespoons of cheese.
8. Fold the right side of the dough over the top of the chicken then repeat with the left side.
9. Brush the top with egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
10. Bake until golden, 20 minutes. Serve hot.
