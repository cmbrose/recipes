## Ingredients
- 3 tablespoons salted butter
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped or grated
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 2 teaspoons dried basil
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- Red pepper flakes
- 1 pound penne pasta
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 1 cup whole milk or canned coconut milk
- 1/2 cup heavy cream or canned coconut milk
- 2 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
- 1 1/2 cups grated parmesan cheese
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- Juice from 1 lemon
- 1/2  shallot, finely chopped
- 2 cups baby arugula
- 1/2 cup mixed fresh herbs, such as parsley and basil
- 1 lb chicken breast


## Directions
1. Cut chicken into small pieces or strips, cook in a cast iron skillet with oil, salt, and pepper. Set aside.
2. In a large pot set over medium heat, melt together the butter, garlic, oregano, basil, onion powder, and a pinch of red pepper. Cook 2-3 minutes until the garlic is fragrant. Pour in 4 cups of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Add 1 teaspoon salt and the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, for 8 minutes. Do not drain the water. Stir in the milk, cream, and cream cheese and cook until the cream cheese has melted and the pasta is al dente, about 4-5 minutes more.
3. Stir in the parmesan until melted and creamy. Remove from the heat. Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper.
4. To make the arugula, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, shallot, and a pinch each of red pepper, salt, and pepper. Add the arugula and mixed herbs, toss to coat.
5. Spoon the pasta into bowls and top with chicken, arugula, and extra parmesan.
