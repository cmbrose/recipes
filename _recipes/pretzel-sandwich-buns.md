## Ingredients
### Dough
- 1 3/4 cups (397g) warm water
- 2 tablespoons (28g) unsalted butter
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 4 1/2 cups (539g) king arthur unbleached bread flour
- 1/4 cup (28g) baker's special dry milk or nonfat dry milk
- 2 teaspoons instant yeast

### Topping
- Pretzel salt or coarse sea salt, e.g., sel gris

### Water Bath
- 2 quarts (1814g) water
- 1 tablespoon (18g) salt
- 1/4 cup (57g) baking soda


## Directions
1. Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Mix and knead the dough ingredients — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — to make a smooth, slightly sticky dough.
2. Allow the dough to rise in a lightly greased bowl, covered, for about 1 hour, until doubled.
3. Gently deflate the dough, and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface.
4. Divide the dough into 10 pieces and shape each piece into a smooth ball. Alternatively, for instructions on how to shape long sub-style sandwich buns, see the tip below.
5. Place the balls on a lightly greased baking sheet, cover, and let rest for 15 minutes.
6. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
7. Prepare the water bath: Bring the water, salt, and baking soda to a boil in a large pot.
8. Drop 5 dough balls at a time into the water bath.
9. Cook for 30 seconds, flip over, and cook for 30 seconds longer. Using a slotted spoon, return the buns to the baking sheet.
10. Using scissors or a sharp knife, cut 1/2"-deep crosses into the center of each bun. Sprinkle with coarse sea salt.
11. Bake the buns for 20 to 24 minutes, or until they're a deep-dark brown. Remove them from the oven, and transfer to a rack to cool.
