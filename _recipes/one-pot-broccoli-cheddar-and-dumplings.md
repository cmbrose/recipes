## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 1  sweet onion, chopped
- 3  carrots, chopped
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 6-7 cups low sodium vegetable broth
- 3 cups fresh or frozen broccoli florets
- 2  bay leaves
- 1/2 cup whole milk
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
- 2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese


## Directions
1. Heat the olive oil and butter together in a large soup pot over medium heat. When the oil shimmers, add the onion and cook 3-5 minutes. Add the carrots and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Cook another 5 minutes.
2. Pour in the broth. Add the broccoli, bay leaves, nutmeg, and cayenne, and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover and cook for 10-15 minutes or until the broccoli is tender.
3. Meanwhile, make the dumplings. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Add the buttermilk, parmesan cheese, and sage, mixing until just combined.
4. Remove the bay leaves from the soup. Transfer 3/4 of the soup to a blender and blend until the broccoli is finely chopped. Return the soup to the pot and bring the soup to a boil over medium-high heat. Drop a heaping tablespoon of the dough into the soup, adding about 6 dumplings to the soup at a time. Cover, and cook for about 8-10 minutes, until the dumplings are cooked through and puffy.
5. Carefully move the dumplings aside, or if easier, remove dumpling from the soup, and stir in the milk and cheddar cheese, cooking until melted. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
6. Ladle the soup and dumplings into bowls and serve topped with pepper. Enjoy!
