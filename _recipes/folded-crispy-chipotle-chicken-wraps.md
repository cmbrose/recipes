## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1 pound boneless skinless chicken tenders, cut into bite size pieces
- 1  yellow onion, chopped
- 2 teaspoons chipotle chili powder
- 1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 6  large tortillas (burrito size)
- 1 cup cooked white or brown rice
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro chopped
- 1  poblano pepper chopped
- 2 cups shredded mexican cheese
- Tajin, for serving

### Spicy Ranch
- 1 cup sour cream or plain greek yogurt
- 3/4 cup fresh cilantro, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1  jalapeño seeded (if desired) and chopped
- Juice from 2 limes
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt


## Directions
1. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the chicken and onion. Cook until the chicken is browned, about 5 minutes. Add the chipotle chili powder, paprika, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, and salt. Add 3/4 cup water. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly around the chicken, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.
2. Meanwhile, make the ranch. Combine all ingredients in a glass jar and shake or stir until creamy.
3. To assemble, cut down from the center of the tortilla to the edge (see above photo). Spread the chicken in the bottom left corner, then add a spoon of rice, a few poblano peppers, and cilantro on the top left corner. Spread the ranch on the top right corner, and the cheese on the bottom right corner (see photos for visuals). Fold the chicken over the rice. Then, working clock-wise, folding that quarter over the ranch. And finally, fold that quarter over the cheese.
4. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a skillet, add 1 wrap and cook 2-3 minutes per side until crisp and golden brown. Sprinkle the wraps with tajin and lime zest. Serve warm with additional ranch, avocado, and any other desired toppings.
