## Ingredients
- 1 1/4 cups whole milk or heavy cream
- 6 ounces frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
- 1 cup shredded fontina cheese
- 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella or creamy gouda
- 1 cup shredded provolone cheese
- 2  medium spaghetti squash, halved and seeds removed
- 1/4 cup grated parmesan
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 1 head garlic
- Olive oil
- 2 tablespoons salted butter, at room temperature
- 1 lb hot Italian sausage 


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 425Â° F.
2. In a medium bowl, mix together the milk, spinach, sage, thyme, fontina, and mozzarella. Season with red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper.
3. Place the squash in a baking dish and season the cut sides with salt and pepper. Sprinkle 1/2 of the provolone cheese into the bottom of each squash, then evenly divide the milk/cheese mix among the squash cavities. Top with the remaining provolone and parmesan. Cover the squash with foil.
4. Slice off the top portion of the garlic head to expose some of the cloves. Place the garlic on a piece of foil. Drizzle with olive oil and wrap it up.
5. Bake the squash and garlic for 30 minutes. Remove the foil from both and continue baking the squash and garlic another 15-20 minutes or until the squash is tender and the cheese is golden brown on top.
6. After removing the foil, start cooking the Italian sausage in a skillet. 
7. Let the garlic cool, then squeeze the cloves out into a bowl. Add the butter and 1 tablespoon sage. Mash the cloves into the butter with a fork. Use a fork to scrape the squash into strands onto a plate. Mix the spinach, squash, butter, and some sausage and serve.
