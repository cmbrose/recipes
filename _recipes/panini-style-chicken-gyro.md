## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs
- 1/2 cup plain full-fat greek yogurt
- 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- Juice from 1 lemon
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 4  garlic cloves, chopped or grated
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 2 teaspoons cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- Kosher salt
- 2  green bell peppers, quartered
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 2  persian cucumbers, chopped
- 1/2 cup mixed fresh herbs, chopped
- 1 1/2 cup shredded gouda or mozzarella
- 6  fresh pitas or naan
- Tzatziki and pickled onions, for serving


## Directions
1. in a bowl, toss the chicken with the yogurt, 2 tablespoons olive oil, lemon juice, vinegar, garlic, paprika, oregano, cumin, and 1 teaspoon salt. Marinate 15-30 minutes or up to 12 hours in the fridge.
2. Meanwhile, toss together the tomatoes, cucumbers, 1 tablespoon olive oil, herbs, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Toss the bell peppers with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
3. Set your grill, grill pan, or skillet to medium-high heat. Grill the chicken until lightly charred and cooked through, about 10 to 12 minutes total. During the same time, grill the peppers until light char marks appear, about 5 minutes. Remove the chicken from the grill and let cool for 5 minutes, then thinly slice.
4. Cut open one side of the pita, creating a small opening. Stuff the chicken, cheese, and peppers, evenly between each pita. If your pitas don't have a pocket, just make quesadilla style and fold 1 half over the other.
5. Heat a panini press or large skillet over medium-high heat. Rub both sides of the pita with olive oil. Place one at a time, into the panini press and cook until the cheese is melted. Alternately, you can cook the sandwiches in a skillet as you would a grilled cheese.
6. Serve each pita with Tzatziki, tomatoes, and cucumber slices on top. Eat!
