- 4 g salt

### Filling and topping

## Directions
1. Note: Caleb tried this with a bad version of the recipe (using 25g of cinnamon instead of 6g and it failed - be warned)
2. Make the levain: In a tall jar or medium bowl, mix the mature starter, flour, and warm water until incorporated. Cover with a lid or clean kitchen towel and leave in a warm place for 3 to 4 hours, or until doubled in size. You can use your levain immediately, or refrigerate it for 12 hours to use later or the next day.
3. Make the final dough: In a large bowl, whisk the warm milk, levain, brown sugar, egg, honey, and vanilla until incorporated, but still kind of lumpy.
4. Add the flour, butter, cinnamon, and salt. Using your hands, mix the ingredients until the dough starts to come together. Once it does not feel too wet, turn it out on to a work surface and knead the dough. Transfer the dough to a clean bowl.
5. Cover the dough and let rest at room temperature for 4 hours. The dough may not fully double in size; that's okay. What you're looking for is a smooth surface, some bubbles and a subtlety sweet smell. Refrigerate the dough, still covered, for 8 to 10 hours. 
6. Filling and topping: You will make two separate items: the filling that will go inside the dough before proofing and the topping that will be drizzled over the bread. One hour before the cold fermentation
is up, make the filling using half the filling and topping ingredients.
7. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine half each of the butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes until it starts to thicken.
8. Mash one of the bananas and mix it into the butter-sugar mixture. 
9. Stir in half the rum. Let the filling simmer on low heat for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat, transfer the mixture to an aluminum bowl, and place it in the freezer for 5 minutes before transferring to the fridge.
10. Repeat this process with the remaining ingredients, but instead of mashing the remaining banana, cut it lengthwise into long slices.
11. Shape and proof the dough: Coat a loaf tin with butter and set aside.
12. Turn the dough out on to a floured work surface and pat it down. Using a rolling pin, roll out a rectangle about ½ inch (1 cm) thick.
13. Use a knife to trim the rounded edges. Remove the filling (with the mashed banana) from the fridge and use a spatula to spread it evenly over the dough. Starting at the longer end of the rectangle, roll the dough into a cylinder and put it into the prepared loaf tin.
14. Place the banana slices on top of the dough and drizzle it with the remaining sauce.
15. Cover the dough with a plastic bag and let proof in a warm area for 4 to 6 hours.
16. Bake the bread: About 30 minutes before the end of your proof, preheat the oven to 375°F. You'll know the dough is almost ready when its popping out of the tin and springy to the touch. If it's ready and you haven't preheated the oven,
don't worry! The extra proof is always welcome with enriched sourdough loaves.
17. Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown and firm in the center. Make sure it’s cooked all the way through, a nice dark color on top is a good sign of this. 
18. Remove the loaf from the oven and
turn it out of the pan and onto a cutting board or wire cooling rack. It's super important that this
one cools before vou cut it so it can finish cooking around the filling areas. Enjoy!
