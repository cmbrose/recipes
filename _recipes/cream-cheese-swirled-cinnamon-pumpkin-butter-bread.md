## Ingredients
- 1 cup pumpkin butter
- 1 cup canned pumpkin puree
- 3/4 cup melted coconut oil
- 1/2 cup maple syrup
- 3  large eggs
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 8 ounces cream cheese, melted
- 1/2 cup cinnamon sugar

### Honey Butter
- 4 tablespoons salted butter, at room temperature
- 2 tablespoons honey


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350° F. Butter 2 (9×5 inch) bread pans.
2. In a large mixing bowl, stir together the pumpkin butter, pumpkin, coconut oil, maple syrup, eggs, and vanilla until combined. Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, pumpkin pie spice, and salt, mix until just combined. Divide half the batter evenly between the prepared bread pans.
3. Spoon teaspoon size amounts of the cream cheese over the batter, using 4 ounces of cream cheese per bread pan. Gently swirl the cream cheese using a sharp paring knife. Sprinkle 2-4 tablespoon of cinnamon sugar over each pan, then evenly spoon the remaining batter over each bread pan, it's OK if all the cream cheese is not covered. Sprinkle 2-4 tablespoons cinnamon sugar over each pan.
4. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until the center is just set.
5. Meanwhile, make the honey butter. In a small bowl, combine the butter, honey, and a pinch of salt.
6. Remove the bread and let cool, or enjoy warm with extra honey butter.
