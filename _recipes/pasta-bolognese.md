## Ingredients
- 4 ounces pancetta, chopped
- 1  yellow onions. chopped
- 1 cup chopped carrots
- 1/2 cup chopped celery
- 1  red bell pepper, chopped
- 6 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 pound ground bison
- 1 pound ground pork
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 2 cans (6 ounce) tomato paste
- 1/2 cup vodka
- 1 can (28 ounce) crushed tomatoes
- 3 sprigs fresh thyme
- 1  bay leaf
- 1  parmesan rind
- 1 cup milk
- 1/3 cup basil pesto
- Cooked pasta, for serving


## Directions
1. In a large dutch oven, cook the pancetta over medium heat, until crispy, 5 minutes. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and red pepper, and cook until the veggies are softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 1 minute.
2. Add the beef, bison, and pork. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up the meat as it cooks, until browned all over, 10 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook 5 minutes, then pour in the vodka. Add the crushed tomatoes, 3 cups water, and fish sauce. Stir in the thyme, bay leaf, and parmesan rind. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 2-3 hours or up to all day. If the sauce seems dry at any point, add up to 1 cup water.
3. Discard the thyme, bay leaf, and parmesan rind. Stir in the milk and pesto, cook until warmed through, 10-15 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, boil the pasta until al dente. Drain and add back to the pot. Ladle the sauce over the pasta and toss to combine. Divide the pasta among bowls and ladle the bolognese over top. Serve topped with parmesan, and fresh herbs. Enjoy!
