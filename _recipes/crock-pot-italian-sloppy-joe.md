## Ingredients
- Italian turkey or chicken sausage 1 lb
- Chopped onions 1/2 cup
- Garlic 3 cloves
- Red bell pepper 1
- Yellow bell pepper 1
- Crushed tomatoes 1 1/3 cups
- Dried rosemary 1/2 teaspoon
- Kosher salt and fresh black pepper

### For serving:
- Italian bread 6 1-inch thick slices
- Olive oil spray
- Dried italian seasoning or parsley
- Grated cheese 2 tbsp
- Garlic clove
- Shredded mozzarella or provolone cheese 1 cup


## Directions
1. In a medium non-stick skillet, cook the sausage over medium-high heat, breaking up as it cooks into small bits until cooked through, about 5-6 minutes.
2. Add onions and garlic, and cook another 2 minutes.
3. Transfer to the slow cooker and add the bell peppers, crushed tomatoes, rosemary and fresh cracked pepper.
4. Cover and cook on low 4 hours.
5. Prepare the garlic bread slices. Place 6 slices of the bread on a sheet pan, spray with olive oil, and sprinkle with Italian Seasoning and Parmesan on each side. Spritz with a little more oil and broil about 6 inches from the heating element, until the top of bread is golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes keeping an eye on it. When toasted, remove from oven and rub a garlic clove over the bread. 
6. Top each slice with 1/2 cup meat and add shredded mozzarella, about 2 1/2 tablespoons on each. Place back into the oven for about 1 to 2 minutes or until cheese is melted.
