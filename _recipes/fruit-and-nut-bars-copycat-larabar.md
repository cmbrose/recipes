## Ingredients
- 1½ cup cashews or almonds
- ½ cup pitted dates
- ½ cup dried cherries  (or dried apples, apricots, raisins, or prunes)
- 3 tablespoons shredded unsweetened coconut
- 3 tablespoons rolled oats


## Directions
1. Place the cashews into a medium bowl and cover with hot water. Let sit for at least 10 and up to 30 minutes. Drain. (This helps the nuts soften enough to grind into the batter.)
2. Add the drained nuts to a food processor with the rest of the ingredients. Grind  into a batter, starting on low and working up to high. (You will likely need to let the machine run for about a minute until the batter starts to hold together like cookie dough.) Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl if needed to help the mixture move thoroughly.
3. Press into a silicone mold (I use a 1-cup Souper Cube) or an 8×8-inch baking pan. Refrigerate for about 10 minutes, then slice into bars.
4. Wrap in plastic wrap and store in a bag or store unwrapped bars in an airtight container.
