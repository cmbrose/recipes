## Ingredients
- 1 pound broccoli crowns
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1½ tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 2 teaspoons dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon maple syrup or honey
- 1  garlic clove
- ¼ teaspoon sea salt
- ⅓ cup diced red onions
- ⅓ cup dried cranberries

### Smoky tamari almonds
- ½ cup almonds
- ½ cup pepitas
- 1 tablespoon tamari
- ½ teaspoon maple syrup
- ¼ teaspoon smoked paprika


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Chop the broccoli florets into ½-inch pieces and any remaining stems into ¼-inch dice. Peel any woody or course parts from the stem first.
3. In the bottom of a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, mayo, apple cider vinegar, mustard, maple syrup, garlic, and salt. Add the broccoli, onions, and cranberries and toss to coat.
4. Place the almonds and pepitas on the baking sheet, toss with the tamari, maple syrup, and smoked paprika and spread into a thin layer. Bake 10 to 14 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes (they’ll get crispier as they sit).
5. Toss the almonds and pepitas into the salad, reserving a few to sprinkle on top. Season to taste and serve.
