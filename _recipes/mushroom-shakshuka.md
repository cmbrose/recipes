## Ingredients
- 3 tbsp olive oil for sautéing
- 6 small/med button mushrooms, sliced
- 1/2 yellow onion, diced
- 1 clove garlic, crushed
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- Pinch of cayenne pepper (optional) 
- 28 oz can whole peeled tomatoes
- 4 eggs
- Salt and pepper


## Directions
1. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat
2. Add mushrooms to skillet and sauté just until they start giving up water
3. Add onion and garlic and continue sautéing until onion is soft
4. Add paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper and stir
5. Add tomatoes, stir, and carefully crush the tomatoes (they can spray when they burst)
6. Bring to a simmer, then make 4 small indents and crack an egg into each
7. Cover and continue to simmer to 10-15 minutes, just until the whites start to set (be careful not to go too long as they will continue to cook as you get ready to serve)
8. Optionally garnish with parsley and serve
