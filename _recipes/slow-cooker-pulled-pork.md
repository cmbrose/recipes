## Ingredients
- Boneless pork loin roast 2.5 lb
- Red wine vinegar 2 tsp
- Hickory liquid smoke 2 tsp
- Garlic powder 1 tsp
- Sea salt 1 tsp
- Homemade kansas city bbq sauce 1 cup


## Directions
1. Place pork in the slow cooker and season with salt, vinegar, garlic powder and liquid smoke.
2. Cover and set to high 6 hours.
3. Remove pork and transfer onto a large dish; reserve all the liquid into a cup and set aside.
4. Shred the pork with two forks and put it back into the slow cooker along with about 3/4 cup of the reserved liquid and the BBQ sauce (for every 3 oz cooked pork, I used 2 tbsp BBQ sauce).
5. Cook on high 1 more hour.
