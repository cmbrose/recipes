## Ingredients
- 2 cups powdered sugar
- 2 Tbsp cocoa
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/2 cup butter or Oleo
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup chopped nuts
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 1 3/4 cup vanilla wafer crumbs

### Other
- Whipped cream (topping)
- Heath or toffee bars, crumbled (see notes)


## Directions
1. Sift sugar with cocoa and salt
2. Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy
3. Add unbeaten egg yolks (save the whites), one at a time
4. Add nuts, vanilla, and stiffly beaten egg whites
5. Alternatingly layer crumbs and batter into a square pan, starting with the crumbs
6. Chill overnight and serve with whipped cream
7. Notes:
- The recipe never mentions the Heath anywhere other than the name. Similar recipes say to add it in the layers or at least put it on top of the whipped cream on the very top
- There's also no mention of cooking the eggs here, it is a cold dessert
