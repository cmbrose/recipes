## Ingredients
- 1 cup warm milk
- 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 4 tablespoons salted butter, at room temperature
- 3  large eggs
- 3 1/2 -4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

### Filling 
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon instant espresso powder
- 6 tablespoons salted butter, at room temperature
- 1/2 cup semi-sweet or dark chocolate

### Glaze 
- 4 tablespoons salted butter at room temperature
- 6 ounces cream cheese at room temperature
- 1/4 cup pure maple syrup
- 1  shot espresso or 1 tablespoon instant espresso powder
- 2-3 cups powdered sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract


## Directions
1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the milk, yeast, and brown sugar. Let sit 5-10 minutes, until bubbly on top. Add the butter, eggs, 3 1/2 cups flour, and salt. Using the dough hook, mix until the flour is completely incorporated, about 4-5 minutes. If the dough is still sticky, add the additional 1/2 cup flour, adding more as needed until the dough is smooth to touch.
2. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
3. Meanwhile, mix the filling. In a bowl, combine the brown sugar, sugar, cinnamon, and espresso powder. Butter a 9×13 inch baking dish.
4. Punch the dough down and roll out onto a lightly floured surface, creating a large rectangle about 12 x 18 inches. Spread the butter evenly over the dough. Sprinkle on the chocolate and cinnamon sugar. Starting with the long edge closest to you, roll the dough into a log, keeping it tight as you go. When you reach the edge, pinch along the edge to seal. Using a sharp knife, cut into 12-15 rolls. Place the rolls into the prepared baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise 15-20 minutes.
5. Preheat the oven to 350° F. Bake the rolls for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown.
6. Meanwhile, make the icing. Add the butter to a pot set over medium heat. Allow the butter to brown lightly until it smells toasted, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat. In a bowl, whisk together the cream cheese and maple syrup. Whisk in the butter, espresso, then add the powdered sugar, vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Spread the icing over the warm rolls. Serve and enjoy!
