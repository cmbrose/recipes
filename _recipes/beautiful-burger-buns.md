## Ingredients
### Buns
- 3 1/2 cups (420g) king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
- 3/4 to 1 cup (170g to 227g) water, lukewarm*
- 2 tablespoons (28g) butter, at room temperature
- 1 large egg
- 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar
- 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
- 1 tablespoon (9g) instant yeast

### Butter glaze
- 3 tablespoons (43g) butter, melted; divided

### Seed topping (optional)
- 1 large egg white, whisked with 2 tablespoons cold water*
- Sesame seeds, or the seeds of your choice


## Directions
1. Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.
2. To make the dough: Mix and knead all of the dough ingredients — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — to make a soft, smooth dough.
3. Cover the dough and let it rise until it's nearly doubled in bulk, about 1 to 2 hours.
4. To shape the buns: Gently deflate the dough and divide it into eight pieces (about 100g each); to make smaller or larger buns see "tips," below. Shape each piece into a ball.
5. Flatten each dough ball with the palm of your hand until it's about 3" across.
6. Place the buns on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover and let rise until noticeably puffy, about an hour. Toward the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 375°F.
7. Brush the buns with about half of the melted butter. To make seeded buns, brush the egg white/water mixture right over the melted butter; it'll make the seeds adhere. Sprinkle buns with the seeds of your choice.
8. To bake the buns: Bake the buns for 15 to 18 minutes, until golden. Remove them from the oven and brush with the remaining melted butter; this will give the buns a satiny, buttery crust. If you've made seeded buns apply the melted butter carefully, to avoid brushing the seeds off the buns.
9. Cool the buns on a rack before slicing in half, horizontally. Use as a base for burgers (beef or plant-based) or any favorite sandwich filling.
10. Storage information: Store leftover buns, well-wrapped, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.
