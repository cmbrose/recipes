## Ingredients
### VEGETABLES
- 1 large sweet potatoes, sliced into 1/4-1/2-inch rounds
- 1 medium head broccoli
- 2 tbsp olive, grape seed or melted coconut oil
- 1 healthy pinch each salt and black pepper
- 1 tsp dried dill
- 1 medium red bell pepper

### CHICKPEAS
- 1 15-ounce can chickpeas
- 1 tbsp olive or grape seed oil
- 1 tbsp tandoori masala spice*
- 1 tsp coconut sugar
- 1 healthy pinch sea salt
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper or red pepper flake

### GARLIC DILL SAUCE
- 1/3 cup hummus
- 3 large cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp dried
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- Water


## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line two (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if increasing batch size) baking sheets with parchment paper (or grease lightly).
2. Add rinsed dried chickpeas to a mixing bowl and season with oil, tandoori spice*, coconut sugar and salt. Toss to combine.
3. Add sweet potatoes and chickpeas to one sheet, and the broccoli to another. Drizzle the vegetables with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper – toss to combine. Sprinkle with dill (optional). Then arrange in a single layer.
4. Bake both for a total of 20-25 minutes, rotating the pans once near the halfway point. You can flip the sweet potatoes over to encourage even baking, but it’s not necessary. You’ll know the broccoli is done when it’s golden brown, the sweet potatoes will be tender, and the chickpeas will begin firming up and taking on a slight crunch. Set aside.
5. While vegetables and chickpeas are baking, prepare dressing by adding hummus, garlic, dill, and lemon juice to a small mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Then add only enough water to thin until pourable. Set aside.
6. To serve, divide vegetables and chickpeas between two serving plates, add bell pepper (optional), and drizzle with dressing, or serve on the side.
7. Best when fresh, though leftovers keep stored separately for 2-3 days in the refrigerator. Enjoy leftovers slightly chilled or at room temperature for best flavor/texture.
