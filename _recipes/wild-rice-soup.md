## Ingredients
### Creamy base
- 1 cup unsweetened almond milk
- ⅓ cup raw cashews
- ¼ cup cooked cannellini beans
- 2 tablespoons white miso paste
- 2 teaspoons dijon mustard

### Soup
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1  bunch scallions
- 1  celery stalk
- 1  large carrot
- 8 ounces cremini mushrooms
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 4  garlic cloves
- 2 tablespoons minced rosemary
- 1  bunch of thyme
- 1¼ cups cooked cannellini beans
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 4 cups water
- 1 cup cooked wild rice
- 1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 4 cups chopped kale
- Chopped parsley for garnish
- Pinches of red pepper flakes


## Directions
1. Make the creamy base: Place the almond milk, cashews, white beans, miso paste, and Dijon mustard in a blender and process until smooth. Set aside.
2. Make the soup: Heat the olive oil in a medium-large Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. Add the scallions, celery, carrot, mushrooms, and salt and stir. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are tender, 8 to 10 minutes.
3. Add the garlic, rosemary, thyme, cannellini beans, pepper, and water and stir. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
4. Remove the thyme bundle and stir in the cashew mixture, rice, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and kale. Simmer over low heat until the kale is wilted, about 5 minutes. Season to taste and serve with more lemon juice, parsley and pinches of red pepper flakes, if desired.
