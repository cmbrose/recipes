## Ingredients
### Salad
- 1 cup shredded carrots
- 1  bell pepper, sliced
- 1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 2  green onions, chopped
- 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce or tamari
- 2 teaspoons honey

### Beef 
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh grated ginger
- Black pepper
- 1/3 cup tamari or soy sauce
- 1/3 cup sweet thai chili sauce
- 2 cups thai or sweet italian basil, chopped
- Sesame seeds and peanuts, for serving


## Directions
1. To make the salad. Combine all ingredients in a bowl. Toss well and set aside.
2. To make the beef. In a large skillet, cook the beef with black pepper over medium heat, breaking up the meat as it cooks until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook another minute. Add the tamari, sweet Thai chili sauce, and 1 cup of fresh basil. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until the sauce coats the beef, 3-5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining basil.
3. Divide the rice and beef between bowls. Add the salad to the bowl. Top with peanuts, sesame seeds, and fresh basil. Enjoy!
4. Add 1 can coconut milk and 1/3 water to a medium-sized pot. Bring to a low boil. Add in 1 1/2 cups jasmine rice and 1 tablespoon lemongrass paste. Stir to combine. Place the lid on the pot and turn the heat down to the lowest setting possible. Allow the rice to cook ten minutes on low and then turn the heat off completely. Let the rice sit on the stove, covered, for another 15-20 minutes (don't take any peeks inside!).
5. After 15-20 minutes remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork. Note that rice can cook differently for everyone, this is just what works for me.
