## Ingredients
### Dough
- 1/2 cup (113g) sourdough starter, ripe (fed) or discard
- 3 cups (360g) king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
- 2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
- 1 tablespoon (14g) sugar
- 1 1/4 teaspoons (8g) salt
- 1 large egg
- 5 tablespoons (71g) butter, at room temperature
- 2/3 cup (152g) water, lukewarm

### Topping
- 4 tablespoons (57g) melted butter, divided
- 1/4 teaspoon paprika, optional


## Directions
1. Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Combine all of the dough ingredients in a large bowl, and mix and knead — using your hands, a stand mixer, or a bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a soft, smooth dough.
2. Place the dough in a lightly greased container — an 8-cup measure works well here — and allow the dough to rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until it's just about doubled in bulk.
3. Gently deflate the dough, and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface.
4. Roll and pat the dough into a rough rectangle approximately 12" x 16". Put 2 tablespoons melted butter in a small bowl, and add the paprika; it's there for color, and accentuates the buns' swirl, but omit it if you wish. Spread the dough with the melted butter.
5. Starting with a long side, roll the dough into a log.
6. Cut the log in 1" slices, using a sharp knife, or a piece of dental floss looped between your fingers.
7. Lightly grease two 8" or 9" round cake pans. Arrange 8 buns in each pan.
8. Cover the pans, and let the buns rise for 60 minutes, until they're noticeably puffy. Don't let these buns rise too long; you want them to have enough rising power left to expand nicely in the oven. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.
9. Uncover the pans, and brush each bun with some of the remaining melted butter.
10. Bake the buns for 22 to 25 minutes; they'll color only slightly.
11. Remove the buns from the oven, and turn them out of the pan onto a rack. Brush with any remaining melted butter. Serve hot or warm. To reheat, place the buns on a baking sheet, tent lightly with aluminum foil, and bake for 10 minutes in a preheated 350°F oven.
12. Wrap any leftover buns airtight, and store at room temperature for several days. For longer storage, wrap airtight and freeze.
