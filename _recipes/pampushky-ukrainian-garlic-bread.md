## Ingredients
### Rolls
- 1 cup milk
- 2 1/4 tsp active yeast (1 packet)
- 2 Tbsp sugar
- 2 Tbsp oil (sunflower or avocado)
- 380g all purpose flour
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 egg (for egg wash)

### Garlic oil
- 3 Tbsp oil (sunflower or avocado)
- 3-4 garlic cloves
- 1 Tbsp fresh chopped parsley 
- 1 Tbsp fresh chopped dill (optional)
- Flake salt (optional)


## Directions
1. For the dough, warm the milk until it is between 80-100 degrees F. â€” just warm to the touch. Add the milk to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment or to a large bowl if kneading by hand. Add the sugar to the milk, then sprinkle the yeast on top. Whisk the mixture and allow it to activate and become foamy for about 5-10 minutes.
2. Once the yeast is activated, add the oil to the milk mixture, then add the flour and salt. If using a stand mixer, start mixing the dough on the lowest setting. Once the dough starts to form a ball, increase the speed to medium and knead for 6-8 minutes. Alternatively, knead for 10-12 minutes by hand. The dough is done when it is elastic, glossy, soft, and easily comes away from the sides of the bowl/surface.
3. Add the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a clean, damp kitchen towel. Let the dough rise for 1-1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in size.
4. Once the dough has risen and doubled in size, punch it down to remove the air, and transfer it to a clean surface. Form the dough into a rectangle, and then divide it into 8 equal-sized pieces; weigh each one to be exact. Form each piece into a ball by pinching the edges inward, and then on a flat surface, roll the dough into a ball shape.
5. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Lightly grease a 9-inch round or square baking dish, preferably metal as opposed to glass or ceramic. Beat the egg for the egg wash. Place each ball of dough in the baking dish, with an equal distance between each ball. Allow the dough to rise a second time for 30 minutes, or until the rolls have puffed up and filled the pan.
6. Brush the tops of the dough with the egg wash and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until deep golden brown.
7. While the rolls bake, make the garlic oil mixture. Finely mince the garlic, then combine it with the oil, chopped dill and chopped parsley. Brush the garlic-herb mixture over the rolls immediately after they come out of the oven. Allow the rolls to cool for 15 minutes before serving. Pampushky can also be served at room temperature or reheated.
