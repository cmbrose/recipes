### turmeric-yogurt sauce
- 3.5 ounces Greek yogurt

- ½ clove minced garlic
- ¼ teaspoon turmeric or curry powder
- ¼ teaspoon sea salt

- 12 Brussels sprouts, coarsely shredded
- ½ gala apple, diced

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 425°F and place a piece of foil on a baking sheet. Use a fork to poke holes into the sweet potatoes, set them on the baking sheet, and roast for 40 to 50 minutes, or until puffed up and soft inside when pierced with a fork.
2. Make the filling: In a medium-small bowl, mix together the quinoa, spinach, feta, red onion, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper. Adjust seasonings to taste. (I like to slightly over-season my filling so that it’s flavorful amongst the whole potato.) Chill until ready to use.
3. Remove the sweet potatoes from the oven and let cool slightly. Slice a wedge lengthwise in each potato and remove to make space for the filling. Add the filling and top with scoops of tzatziki.
4. Make the filling: In a medium-small bowl, mix together the cabbage, black beans, serrano, pepitas, olive oil, lime juice, chili powder, and salt. Adjust seasonings to taste. (I like to slightly overseason my filling so that it’s flavorful amongst the whole potato.) Chill until ready to use.
5. Just before serving, make the guac: Use the back of a fork to mash together the avocado, lime juice, and salt.
6. Remove the sweet potatoes from the oven and let cool slightly. Slice a wedge lengthwise in each potato and remove to make space for the filling. Add the filling and top with the guac. Serve with the salsa on the side.
7. Make the filling: While the sweet potatoes bake, spread the chickpeas on a separate baking sheet, drizzle them with olive oil and pinches of salt and pepper, and roast for 25 minutes or until golden brown and crispy around the edges. Remove the chickpeas from the oven and while they are still hot, toss them with the curry powder. Set aside until ready to use.
8. Make the sauce: In a small bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, turmeric, and salt. Chill until ready to use.
9. Just before the sweet potatoes are done, place the kale leaves into the oven on the same baking sheet and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until wilted. Remove, chop, and set aside.
10. Remove the sweet potatoes from the oven and let cool slightly. Slice a wedge lengthwise in each potato and remove to make space for the filling. Stuff with some of the chickpeas, the chopped kale, and the cilantro. Top with a scoop of sauce and serve with the remaining sauce on the side.
11. Save extra chickpeas for snacking.
12. Make the filling: In a medium bowl mix together the Brussels sprouts, apple, radish, feta, cranberries, olive oil, apple cider vinegar, salt, and pepper. Season to taste. I like this one to really pop with the vinegar so that the flavors stand up to the whole sweet potato. Also, this is the only potato without a sauce, so make sure your salad filling is not dry.
13. Remove the sweet potatoes from the oven and let cool slightly. Slice a wedge lengthwise in each potato and remove to make space for the filling. Scoop in the filling and season to taste.
