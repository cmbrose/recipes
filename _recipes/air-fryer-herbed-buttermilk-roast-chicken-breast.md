## Ingredients
- Large bone-in skin-on split chicken breast 1
- 1% buttermilk 1 cup
- Dried parsley 1 1/2 teaspoons
- Fresh or dried chives 1 1/2 teaspoons
- Kosher salt 3/4 teaspoon
- Dried dill 1/2 teaspoon
- Onion powder 1/2 teaspoon
- Garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon
- Olive oil spray


## Directions
1. Place the chicken in a bowl and pour the buttermilk over, covering completely. Set chicken at room temperature at least 20 minutes or refrigerated up to 4 hours.
2. Meanwhile in a bowl combine the remaining spices.
3. Remove the chicken from the buttermilk, letting the excess drip off, then place skin side up into the air fryer. 
4. Sprinkle the seasoning mix over the top of both and let it stand 5 minutes until it soaks in.
5. Spray the top of the chicken with oil. Cook at 300F for 10 minutes then increase the heat to 350F and cook until an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 160F, and the chicken is golden in color, 30 to 35 minutes.
6. Transfer to a cutting board and let it rest 10 minutes. Then cut the meat off the bone and cut into thick slices for serving.
