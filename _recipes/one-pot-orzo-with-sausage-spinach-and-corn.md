## Ingredients
- Mild italian chicken sausage 14 ounces
- Medium yellow onion ½
- Frozen corn kernels 1 cup
- Dry orzo 1 cup
- Low sodium chicken broth 3 cups
- Packed baby spinach 3 cups
- Freshly grated parmesan ¼ cup
- Freshly ground black pepper


## Directions
1. Remove the sausage from the casing and add it to a heavy bottom sauce pot or Dutch oven.
2. Cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes, breaking it up with a wooden spoon.
3. Add the onion and corn (no need to thaw) and sauté for 10 minutes.
4. Add the orzo and chicken broth, stir to combine then bring to a boil.
5. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer 10 minutes, stirring every few minutes and scraping the bottom of the pot to make sure the orzo doesn’t stick.
6. Remove from the heat, add the spinach, stir and cover for a couple minutes, until the spinach has wilted.
7. Top with freshly grated parmesan and black pepper, to taste and serve.
