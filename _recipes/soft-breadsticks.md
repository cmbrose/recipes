## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups (340g) lukewarm water
- 3 tablespoons (35g) olive oil, plus additional for drizzling
- 1 1/4 teaspoons (8g) salt
- 3 1/2 cups (420g) king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon instant yeast
- 4 teaspoons pizza dough flavor, optional
- Pizza seasoning or italian seasoning, to sprinkle on top


## Directions
1. Lightly grease an 18" x 13" pan (half sheet pan), and drizzle 1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil in the bottom.
2. Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Combine all of the ingredients, and beat at high speed with an electric mixer for 60 seconds.
3. Scoop the sticky batter into the prepared pan, spreading it nearly to the edges. Oiling your fingers helps with the job.
4. Use a rolling pizza wheel or knife to score the dough in 3/4" to 1" wide crosswise strips, to make 13"-long strips. Score the dough once lengthwise, so that you now have 6 1/2"-long strips. Cover the pan, and let the dough rise at room temperature for 60 minutes, till it's become puffy.
5. While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 375Â°F.
6. Drizzle the dough lightly with olive oil, and sprinkle with pizza seasoning, and/or the dried herbs of your choice.
7. Bake the bread till it's a very light golden brown, about 25 minutes.
8. Remove it from the oven, and carefully lift it out of the pan onto a rack.
9. As soon as you can handle it, cut the dough along the score lines. A pair of scissors works well here.
10. Place the bread sticks back on their baking pan, on edge. You can put them close together. Return them to the oven, and bake for 5 minutes (for soft bread sticks), or 10 minutes (for bread sticks that can stand up to a stiffer dip).
11. Remove them from the oven, and serve warm, or at room temperature.
