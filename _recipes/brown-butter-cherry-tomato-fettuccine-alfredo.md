## Ingredients
- 1 pound fettuccine pasta
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 2 cups small cherry tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons freshly chopped sage
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes
- 1 pinch each kosher salt and black pepper
- 4 tablespoons salted butter
- 3 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 tablespoon freshly chopped oregano
- 2 cups whole milk or canned coconut milk
- 1/2 cup heavy cream or canned coconut milk
- 2 ounces cream cheese
- 1 1/2 cups grated parmesan or pecorino romano
- 1 cup freshly chopped basil
- 1 lb chicken


## Directions
1. Cube or slice chicken and cook in a cast iron with oil, salt, pepper, and Cajun seasoning. Set aside. 
2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to package directions until al dente. Drain.
3. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil, tomatoes, 1 tablespoon sage, and a pinch each of red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Cook until the tomatoes just begin to burst, about 8 minutes. Remove from the skillet to a plate.
4. To the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat, cooking until the butter begins to brown, about 3-4 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, add the garlic, oregano, 1 tablespoon sage, and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Cook 1 minute, then pour in the milk and cream. Add the cream cheese. Whisk until smooth. Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer and cook 5-8 minutes, until thickened slightly. Stir in the parmesan. Season with salt + pepper. Toss in the pasta and basil and cook 3-5 minutes, then remove from the heat.
5. Divide the fettuccine between plates and top with tomatoes and chicken. Eat and enjoy immediately.
