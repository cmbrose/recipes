## Ingredients
- 3 tbsp vegan butter
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 1 lb mushrooms, sliced
- 3/4 tsp dried thyme
- 3/4 tsp dried rosemary
- 3/4 tsp sea salt and pepper
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp cornstarch
- 2 tsp tamari or soy sauce
- 1 tbsp dijon mustard
- 3 cups vegetable broth
- 1 lb baby potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 2 (15 oz.) cans white beans, drained and rinsed
- 2 cups dairy-free milk

### FOR SERVING optional
- Fresh parsley, finely chopped


## Directions
1. Add the vegan butter to a large pot or Dutch oven and heat over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the onion and saut√© for a few minutes. Next add mushrooms, thyme, rosemary, sea salt, and pepper. Cook for 7-10 minutes or until the mushrooms have released most of their moisture and begin to brown. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.
2. Next add the cornstarch and stir to coat the vegetables. Then add the tamari and mustard and stir again. Add the vegetable broth and potatoes and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat and simmer (uncovered) for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally.
3. Stir in the beans and dairy-free milk and simmer (uncovered) for another 10-15 minutes until the vegetables are tender and the stew has thickened (it will continue to thicken as it cools). Adjust for seasoning and thickness as needed, adding more tamari or salt for saltiness, mustard for acidity, or dairy-free milk to thin it slightly.
4. Serve warm and optionally garnish with parsley and a sprinkle of freshly cracked black pepper.
5. Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month. It will thicken as it sits. To thin, add more broth, dairy-free milk, or water when you reheat.
