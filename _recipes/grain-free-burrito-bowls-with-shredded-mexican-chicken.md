## Ingredients

- 1 batch shredded mexican chicken*

### SWEET POTATOES
- 1 medium sweet potato, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds
- 1 tsp avocado oil

### BEANS
- 1 15-ounce can black beans, slightly drained
- 1/4 tsp ground cumin
- 1/4 tsp chili powder
- 1/4 tsp sea salt

### THE REST
- 1 tsp avocado oil
- 1 medium red bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced
- Sea salt to taste

### CAULIFLOWER RICE
- 1 medium head cauliflower
- 1 tsp avocado oil
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin

### FOR SERVING optional

## Directions
1. If serving with chicken, prepare at this time (follow link for instructions). Cover to keep warm until serving.
2. In the meantime, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Add sliced sweet potatoes and toss with a little oil to coat. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until tender.
3. In the meantime, add slightly drained black beans to a small saucepan or pot and heat over medium heat. Add spices and salt and stir to coat. Once simmering, reduce heat to low, cover, and continue cooking until the beans are bubbly and hot and the liquid has reduced a bit. OPTIONAL: Mash with a potato masher or the back of your mixing spoon for more of a refried bean texture.
4. In the meantime, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, peppers, onions, and a pinch of salt to taste. Sauté, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and light golden brown — about 5 minutes. Turn off heat but leave resting on burner to keep warm until serving.
5. Next, prepare cauliflower rice in a food processor or using a box grater (methods detailed here) and heat a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Once hot add oil, cauliflower rice, spices, and salt. Sauté, stirring occasionally, until slightly tender and very lightly browned — about 3-4 minutes. Add lime juice (optional) and stir. Turn off heat, cover, and set aside until serving.
6. To serve, divide cauliflower rice between serving bowls and top with roasted sweet potatoes, shredded chicken, black beans, peppers and onions, and any other desired toppings or garnishes such as guacamole, cilantro, salsa, and tortilla chips (garnishes/toppings optional).
7. Store cooled leftovers (guacamole, herbs, and salsa separate) in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. (NOTE: Cauliflower rice doesn’t reheat well after freezing, so consider making fresh upon serving). Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop until hot.
