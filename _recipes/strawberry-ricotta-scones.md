## Ingredients
- 20 oz strawberries
- 345 g cake flour
- 50 g sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 stick butter cut into 1/2” cubes, chilled
- 3/4 c whole milk ricotta
- 1 cup buttermilk
- Demerara sugar for sprinkling 
- (Optional) fresh basil, 2-3 bunches


## Directions
1. Before starting, strain ricotta for at least 2 hours
2. Before starting, measure flour and chill in the fridge
3. Very roughly chop strawberries, partially dehydrate on a baking sheet silicon mat at 250 for 60-80 min, and let cool
4. If using, chop basil into sprinkle-able pieces
5. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda in a medium bowl
6. Add butter to flour mixture and toss to coat
7. Smash butter between thumb and fingers in sheets, leaving some good size chunks
8. Make a well in the flour and pour in buttermilk, reserving a couple tablespoons for brushing later
9. Mix with a fork until shaggy then drop in ricotta in chunks and continue stirring
10. Flour the counter and pour mixture out onto it
11. Mix the dough but picking it up and letting it fall through your fingers until mostly hydrated - some extra dry or extra wet portions are fine
12. Pat dough into a square and roll out into a rectangle 1/2” thick
13. Make a sandwich by spreading about half the strawberries and basil (if using) over one half of the dough, cutting the dough in half with a bench scraper, and lifting the half without strawberries onto the side with strawberries
14. If dough is getting soft, chill in the fridge 10 min
15. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and roll out into a 3/4” thick rectangle
16. Repeat the sandwiching step and roll into a 7”x7” square
17. If there are any strawberries leftover, press them into the top of the dough
18. Place dough onto pan with parchment, chill in the freezer 15-20 min, and preheat the oven to 425
19. Cut the dough into 8 triangles but cutting in half vertically and horizontally (into 4 pieces) and then cut each piece diagonally
20. Spread out triangles across the sheet and brush with buttermilk and sprinkle Demerara sugar
21. Reduce oven to 400 and bake 20-25 min
22. Let cool 15-20 min before eating
