## Ingredients
- 1/3 cup full-fat plain greek yogurt
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cubed
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
- 6  garlic cloves, chopped
- 2  shallots, chopped
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
- Red pepper flakes
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 6  fresh pitas or naan warmed,
- Pickled red onion, lettuce, dill, and parsley for serving

### Feta Tzatziki
- 8 ounces feta cheese
- 1/4 cup + 1/3 cup plain greek yogurt
- 2 cloves garlic grated
- Juice from 1 lemon
- 1-2  persian cucumbers, shredded
- Kosher salt


## Directions
1. In a bowl, combine the yogurt, olive oil, cubed chicken, lemon juice, garlic, shallots, paprika, oregano, chili flakes, and a large pinch each of salt and pepper. Let marinate for 15 minutes at room temperature or up to overnight in the refrigerator.
2. Preheat the oven to 425° F. Arrange the chicken on a baking sheet. Bake 15 minutes, toss and bake another 5-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Switch the oven to broil. Broil 1-2 minutes, until the chicken chars on the edges (watch carefully)
3. Meanwhile, make the Tzatziki. Combine the feta, 1/4 cup yogurt, garlic, and lemon juice in a blender and blend until creamy. Stir in 1/3 cup more yogurt, the cucumbers, and a pinch of salt and red pepper flakes.
4. To assemble, stuff/spread each pita with tzatziki, then lettuce, and chicken. Add red onions and herbs. Drizzle over more tzatziki and if desired, harissa (recipe in notes).
