## Ingredients
- 10 eggs
- 2 1/4 cups whole milk
- 1 1/2 tsp ground mustard
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 lb breakfast port sausage
- 2 cups bread (preferably sourdough), cubed
- 1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar


## Directions
1. Fully cook sausage, drain, and set aside to cool
2. Beat eggs in a large bowl and mix in milk, mustard, salt, and cheese
3. Lightly toast bread in the oven - about 10 min at 200°F works well for fresh bread
4. Put bread into 9x13 pan, then add sausage and egg mixture and mix well
5. Cover and refrigerate overnight
6. The next day, cook uncovered at 350°F for 35-45 min, until the eggs are set and the center wobbles only slightly
