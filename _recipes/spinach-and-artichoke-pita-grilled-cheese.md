## Ingredients

## Directions
1. In a bowl, combine the spinach, artichokes, mozzarella, gouda, parmesan, basil, and a pinch each of red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper.
2. Cut open one side of the pita, creating a small opening. Stuff the cheese mixture evenly between each pita. if your pitas don't have a pocket, just slice in half and layer with the cheese.
3. Butter the outside of each pita.
4. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Place the pita, one at a time, in the skillet and cook until golden on each side, about 3-4 minutes per side. Serve topped with honey, chili flakes, and sea salt (if desired). Enjoy!
