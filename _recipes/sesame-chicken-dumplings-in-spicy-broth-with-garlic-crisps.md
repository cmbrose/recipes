## Ingredients
- 1 pound ground chicken or pork
- 2 tablespoons fresh grated ginger
- 1 clove garlic, minced or grated
- 2 cups roughly chopped spinach or bok choy
- 2 tablespoons plus, 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce or tamari
- Black pepper
- 24-26  round dumpling or wonton wrappers
- 1/4 cup plus, 1 tablespoon raw sesame seeds
- 3-4  medium shallots, thinly sliced
- 3 cups low sodium chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 5 tablespoons sesame or olive oil
- 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced or smashed
- Crushed red pepper flakes
- Green onions for serving


## Directions
1. In a medium bowl, combine the raw chicken, bok choy, 1 tablespoon ginger, garlic, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, and a pinch of black pepper.
2. To assemble, spoon 1 tablespoon of filling onto each wrapper. Brush water around the edges of the wrapper. Fold the edges of the wrapper up and around the filling and pinch in the center to seal. Repeat with the remaining wrappers. Place the sesame seeds in a shallow bowl. Brush the bottoms of the dumplings with water and then dredge them in the sesame seeds.
3. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a medium pot. When the oil shimmers, add the shallots and cook until fragrant and caramelized, about 4 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon ginger and cook another minute. Add the broth, 1/4 cup soy sauce, and the rice vinegar. Season to taste with pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Keep warm.
4. Heat a few tablespoons of oil in a large skillet set over medium heat. When the oil shimmers, add the dumplings and cook until the bottoms are golden brown, about 2-3 minutes. Carefully pour 1/4 cup of water into the skillet, it will splatter, so stand back. Immediately cover with a tight-fitting lid. Turn heat to medium-low and let the dumplings steam for 5-6 minutes. Remove the dumplings from the skillet to a plate.
5. In the same skillet, add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, the Panko, thinly sliced garlic, 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, and a large pinch of red pepper flakes. Cook until lightly toasted, 3 minutes. Watch closely. Spoon the crumbs out of the skillet onto a plate.
6. Arrange the dumplings in shallow bowls. Ladle the steaming broth over top. Top with garlic crisps, green onions, and chili oil. Enjoy!
