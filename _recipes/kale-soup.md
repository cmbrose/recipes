## Ingredients
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1  medium yellow onion
- 1  medium carrot
- 2  celery ribs
- 2  garlic cloves
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 4½ cups cooked white beans
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 6 cups chopped kale leaves
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- Homemade croutons
- Fresh parsley


## Directions
1. Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion, carrot, celery, garlic, rosemary, salt, thyme, and several grinds of pepper. Cook for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until softened. Add the beans and broth. Simmer for 20 minutes.
2. Transfer half the soup to a blender and blend until smooth. Stir the puree back into the pot and add the kale and lemon juice. Cook, stirring, until the kale is wilted, about 5 minutes. If the soup is too thick, stir in water, ½ cup at a time, until it reaches your desired consistency. Season to taste (I usually add another ¼ teaspoon salt at this point) and serve with a drizzle of olive oil, croutons, and fresh parsley for garnish.
