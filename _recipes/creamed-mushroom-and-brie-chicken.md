## Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 6  boneless chicken breasts or thighs
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 3 cups shiitake or cremini mushrooms, sliced
- 2  shallots, chopped
- 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
- Red pepper flakes
- 3 cloves garlic, chopped or grated
- 1 1/4 cups dry white, wine such as pinot grigio
- 1 â€“ 1 1/4 cups heavy cream or canned coconut milk
- 2-4 ounces brie, rind removed


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and season with salt and pepper. Sear on both sides until golden, about 3-5 minutes per side. Add 1 tablespoon butter and allow the butter to brown around the chicken, about 2 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet.
3. To the skillet, add the mushrooms. Cook undisturbed for 5 minutes or until golden. Add 2 tablespoons butter, the shallots, thyme, sage, oregano, and a pinch each of salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Cook 4-5 minutes, until fragrant. Add the garlic. Cook another 2-3 minutes, until the mushrooms have caramelized.
4. Pour in the wine. Cook 10 minutes until reduced slightly, then pour in the cream and stir in the brie. Nestle the chicken into the sauce. Bake 20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.
5. Serve the chicken and sauce over mashed potatoes, pasta, or steamed rice. Top with fresh thyme or parsley.
