2. Place the oats, coconut, and flaxseed into the food processor and process for about 30 seconds or until the oats resemble a coarse flour.
3. Add the rest of the ingredients except the blueberries and process to combine well.
4. Remove the blade and stir in the blueberries.
5. Spoon into the prepared muffin cups just to the brim.
